      <td>Okay...at the risk of being tarred and feathered, I just don't get the whole Coldplay thing.  Yeah, I think some of their songs are pretty good, but damn...you guys are passionate about them fellas.  (I'm sorry if I'm lumping Stoner with the rest of y'all...I'm not sure if she's a fan or not.)  Admittedly, I haven't heard either albums of theirs all the way through, but there hasn't been anything too significant (that I've heard) that just grabs me.  Sorry, friends.  Personally, I thought the Simon and Garfunkel thing felt awkward.  It's pretty obvious that Art hasn't been doing much these days and it kind of showed.  I don't know if it's because it's Madison Square Garden or what, but a lot of the performances were pretty flat.  They didn't seem like they wanted to be perfoming together...and for the record, I love me some Pauly Simon.    I thought the Nelly/Kelly Rowlands thing was almost unwatchable.  Mixing his two hits together didn't work well and it showed.  Afterwards, Nellyson had a look on his face that said  'Even this fake bandaid on my face isn't gonna save this one.'</td>

      <td>Odd Facts About Husband   Is it men or is it just my husband?  Here, some puzzling facts involving my husband, Woody:  1. I came home tonite after having done the groceries and was putting away food in the fridge when I saw our clear plastic jug filled with white stuff.  I'm thinking, curdled milk, coconut milk, what is that white stuff?    It was leftover rice.  He stored our leftover rice in a clear plastic jug.  I wrote on our eraser board:  please don't put our rice in clear plastic jug again, because...well, its just weird!   2. Husband, as mentioned above, is a great sneezer.  And not just when I've gotten him sick.  Once, back when we were in college, he regaled me with tales of his allergy attack in class.  He started sneezing and the whole class counted each sneeze...he sneezed once, twice, three times....by this time the whole class was amused....four times, five, six....the class started getting excited --will it break a record?---seven, eight, nine....the class started counting out loud as a group....ten, evelen....sixteen sneezes!    The class went wild, they hailed him a hero, a god! They carried him on their shoulders, out the classroom door, out the school building singing 'for he's a jolly good fellow'.    Okay, maybe the last part never happened.  3. Husband will insist we do not clean up after ourselves when we eat in fast food restaurants.  He believes if we clean up after ourselves it will steal jobs away from the low-paid workers who work in such restaurants.  We have to do what we can to make them indispensable, he insists.  This fact obliges me to make sure I carry all our after-eating trash to the trash bin myself.  4.  Husband always insists we are broke.  Even when we have money.  When I try to tell him how much money we actually have he'll stop me.  He wants to always think we're broke.  He doesn't want to feel like he can spend whatever we want because we have money in the bank....okay maybe this is actually a good idea.  5. Husband wears underwear for multiple days until I threaten to take a match to said underwear, then he changes it.    Odd husband, loving husband, lovable husband. =) -</td>

      <td>Am I typing in color? Blogger has got some new shit.     &amp;nbsp;   Lots to share, let's begin.     &amp;nbsp;   Thursday I babysat in the morning, and then I drove to Anna's, where I could not park my car properly, and had to have her do it for me. We stopped at Wal-Mart, like we always do before a trip, and when we were leaving she goes, 'I think I'll take out the Starting Line CD' and then what do we hear? 'THE REASON' DAMNIT I'M SO SICK OF THAT SONG. We drove up to Cleveland to see Never Heard Of It. I named all the counties along the way. We headed towards The Phantasy Nite Club, which was crappy and old. We walked around, cause nobody was there. Well, we did see this kid walking with his parents wearing pants that said 'Fuck' all over them. We went into the drug store to go pee. We had to go to the courtesy counter and ask through the bullet-proof glass for the key. Anna saw a bunch of Hostess products, Ohio never fails us! We went back to wait in line/by the door. The band still hadn't arrived. But then, I saw the RV. They drove by and DJ was looking out the window and we waved. So attractive. Their RV is PIMPING! It has their name all over it and they have a trailer with good stickers. DJ walked around and gave us hugs and we talked about Anna's upcoming interview. We had to talk to their tour manager or something, Nosh (don't know how to spell, sounds like 'No-shhhh'). Rick walked around, but he ignored us and looked really bad. I hate to say it, but bring back the California surfer-dude hair, and lose the nose ring. It looked like he always had a booger, but it was the ball on his nose ring. We sat with Jeff for literally two hours. He kept having Anna massage his back. She tried standing up, but he thought that was weird, so he asked to sit between her legs- WHOA! He was so needy. Every five minutes he'd be like 'Higher... no lower. Now scratch it.' EWW I glared at him and he goes, 'You must think I'm a dick.' He was really nice the first night, but more on that later. We learned that since Greg's departure, they brought on this 17-year-old named Dan. I was quite excited to see this kid. They weren't playing until 10:45, so we didn't go inside until about 9. We were actually on the list, SURPRISE! The first two bands we saw were okay. The club had all these black lights, which revealed several embarrassing stains on my jeans. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY GOT THERE! We met NHOI's new merch guy, but I can't remember his name. I want to say Kevin, maybe that's right. He shook our hands and winked, it was quite cute. Anna bought&amp;nbsp;the tequila shirt of theirs, and I read the Spanish part. Finally, they went on. Dan was really cute! He had a semi-mullet, but he had a lip ring- ON THE GOOD SIDE! Anna told me that when DJ sings he gets right in your face. I told her he better not, cause that will scare me. And scare me it did, cause he gets right up in your grill. Then he'd shake his head and his sweat would go everywhere! They were very good live. Lots of energy. But they didn't play 'Veronica' like Jeff said they would. After, we went back to the merch table. DJ apologized that they didn't play 'Veronica' but said that they would the next night. We met Dan, who was just as cute in person. On their message boards, people say he can guess your birthday. We tried to play the game, but he didn't do so well. The guys seemed to like my 'Real Men Love Unicorns' t-shirt. Dan said he loves unicorns, the beach, marshmallows, and the color pink. Good boy. There was this girl there with these tattoos. One on her arm was of a naked woman. Dan kept going over and pinching the boobs, and Anna goes, 'Look! You got some action!'. Then the girl pulls down her pants and shows this weird tattoo on her thigh. I saw some stuff of hers, I don't think she wanted to share. She should probably keep her pants buckled, I mean, just a thought. When we were driving home, Anna called her friend, Karly, and told her about the massage thing and him being between her legs. Karly was on spearkerphone, and I heard her ask, 'Did you get wet?' I STARTED LAUGHING SO HARD- WHO IS THIS KID?!    We went to my aunt's house, where she had labeled everything we would use, and then watched some Blind Date and went to bed. The next morning we went to my aunt Sue's to burn a copy of the Lola Ray CD for Jeff, he had asked for it. Then we got ready and drove to Toledo for the show. Anna saw a sign for 'Fangboner Road'. It made us remember Texas and how we giggled at 'Harry Hines Boulevard' or as I called it, 'Harry Hinds Boulevard!'&amp;nbsp;The place was called 'Missi's Blues' or something like that.&amp;nbsp; But it was spelled M-I-S-S-I... that's HORRIBLE! They didn't show up for a while. Finally, the huge NHOI RV pulled up. We gave Jeff his CD and Dan some beads to put on his shoelaces, Anna's newest creation. The guys were pretty nice and everything. Nosh said we'd do the interview around 5:30. Jeff took these two girls into the RV. Finally NOSH was like, 'Yeah, Jeff will come get you when he's finished getting his 'massage'!' WHAT?! Anna gives him massages, not those two ho's. What was THAT about? That began the dislike for Jeff. Around 6 or so, once it started to pour rain (of course), Nosh calls out from the RV 'Allie, come on in!' Who's Allie? Well, he meant us. He got confused. Anna was like, 'Her name is Allison...' and he's like 'Yeah yeah.' Okay, whatever. We walk in the RV and those skanks with Jeff were there. One was adjusting her boobs. Right.... a back massage? Try lower. Nosh kicked them out, thankfully. Jeff and DJ were doing the interview. I turned my head and saw Rick without his shirt on. I was very embarrassed. The interview went pretty well. Then we left and talked to Dan outside a little. He's from Mexico and speaks Spanish, very nice. We went inside and talked to him a lot more there.&amp;nbsp; He is a funny kid. Let me remember some good stuff: at one point he was talking about something (I can't remember what) and then he goes, 'That'll be my thing.' And Anna goes 'And putting beads on your shoelaces can be my thing.' And I asked, 'Well what can be my thing?' And Dan goes, 'We can put our things together.' MY EYES GOT SO BIG AND I JUST STARTED LAUGHING. He forgot our birthdays, but kept trying to guess. He was staring at me trying to remember, and I got nervous and was biting my lip and scrunching my face, and he goes, 'I love that face!' I'm so scared of eye contact! Then we were talking and he's like, 'You wanna go on a date?' HELL YEAH. He says 'Fuck yeah, dude' all the time. He wants to tattoo it across his stomach. That's hot. He gave us guitar picks, but then borrowed mine for the show. He promised to give it back, and after the show he&amp;nbsp;he did as he said 'Sorry it's so gross and wet'. No problem, I don't mind. We talked a little more to some of&amp;nbsp;the guys and these kids from Michigan. We were saying bye to Nosh, and DJ walked over and just put his arm around me. My god, that man smells like angels, it's amazing. And his back, talk about definition. SO hot. Rick was a lot nicer the second night, but Jeff became a dick. Overall, it was a pretty good time! We drove home and then I went back to mi casa to go to sleep and prepare for Saturday.   &amp;nbsp;   So let's begin with Saturday. It was a good day. I was going to volunteer for the Young Voters Project. I went there at 11 to have a training session with Stephen. This annoying 20-something-year-old guy, Jeremy, joined us and kept trying to be better than me. After our session, some of the workers started to come in for the day. This kid, Luke, was leaning against the wall reading the newspaper. He had a hat on and his headphones around his neck, he was kind of cute. RJ drove myself, Luke, Becca, and the funniest kid I've ever met, James, down to the Jazz and Rib Festival where we'd be trying to get people to sign our petition to vote this November. James was like 'Are you excited?' and I said yes, and he goes, 'You sure don't look it!' And I was like 'NOO... I am just really tired, I was out of town yesterday.' They were talking about going out that night and James asked me what I was doing and he goes, 'You're 18 right?' And I said no, and nobody believed me that I was 17. RJ dropped us off and then we set off for the festival. James kept freaking out about jay walking (is it like that or is it just 'j walking', I don't really know) and he goes, 'When I was a kid, I thought it was just walking in a 'J''. Then he started doing it in the middle of the road. We got up to the festival and James was going on about how he had to pee. We stopped at a Port-a-Potty, but he goes, 'I won't go in those, just find me a tree!' Then Luke goes, 'Okay James and Becca you stay at this entrance. Allison and I will go down to the other.' Great, I have to spend 4 hours with some relatively cute guy, I wonder how I will embarrass myself today. So we walk down and he was telling me that he's from NYC and is just here for 6 weeks to work on this project. He was like, 'Yeah, I'm going to do my part to take Bush down!' So now you're 10 times cuter. Actually, he really wasn't that cute, but he does oddly resemble Jason Mraz.&amp;nbsp; Something in the eyes. So I watched him talk to people in the beginning. A bunch of people were jerks and wouldn't listen, then we get one. The first guy is some hick, but he was a good guy.&amp;nbsp; He was like 'At first, I thought Bush was&amp;nbsp;a good idea. But now, this is horrible...' and he went on and on and he was swearing like none other! Luke was like, 'Yeah man, that anger is understandable.' I was biting my lip trying to not laugh. This kid is from NYC and here he is talking to this hick guy with no teeth. Welcome to Ohio. Then I went off to talk to this couple. This guy comes over and starts talking to me when they are finished:     Guy: 'What are you doing?'       I explain the petition and ask if he wants to sign    Guy: 'No, I don't want to sign that, I want to know what you are doing. I think you are really cute. Maybe we could hang out some time.'    Me:  completely perplexed  'Uhhh... I don't think that's such a good idea.'    Guy: 'Why?'    Me:  so nervous I lie : 'Well, I just got out of something, and I think I need some time to work on myself.'    Guy: 'What did this guy do to you? I mean we can be friends, you know. You can have friends. I don't even live here, but I'll drive here for you.'    Me: 'Yeah I just don't think it's a good idea.'    Guy: 'Can't I just call you?'    It kept going on and I didn't know what to do! My head was in my hands and I was like 'Fine take my fucking number' and gave it to him. I was going to make one up, but I felt so bad. Then he was like 'I can feed you and that dude.' NO, live me alone! So I walked back over to Luke looking down, cause that guy kept staring and motioning for him to get us food or something, and Luke asked what was wrong, but I said nothing. So then we started to get people to sign the petition. Four hours later... it was so god damn hot. We started to head back to get picked up and James joined us. That kid is so funny. Luke was pissed cause he was 3 signatures less than 50. James asked me how many I got and I told him 40. He was really impressed and Luke asked how many I got and when I told him his eyes got so big. They were like, 'That's really good for your first day!' I was pretty proud of myself. So as we were walking back, James kept going on about how he hates Ohio and how black people don't take care of each other here the way they do in Georgia. Then he was saying he's never lived in a more racist place, and I was like, 'You're from the South!' I told him I went to CSG and he goes, 'My mom tried to sign me up there. No, I'm not kidding. I don't do well around guys.' Then he started freaking out about jay walking again and started to walk in the crosswalk when it said 'Don't Walk'. I told him, 'I really don't think it's jay walking if you are in the crosswalk.' Then we started talking about girls in NYC. James was like, 'They have the finest lookin Dominican women there. Every girl's got a J. Lo booty!' Luke asked me if I was Dominican, no no I'm not anything but English, Czech, and Indian DAMNIT! James goes, 'My baby's mama is a beautiful Dominican girl.' Then he talked about how his father and brother were in the Crips and how he NEVER wears red and all that. James is a funny, funny guy. There were all these Pro-Life people, so in the car Luke goes, 'There's pro-choice and pro-life, why don't they make a category where they kill all the babies?!' I thought that was funny, actually. Then we went back to the headquarters and did these time&amp;nbsp;sheets thing. They were long and hard. Stephen gave me a huge hug when I got back. As I've told Anna, my three rules are: 1. Don't touch me. 2. Don't talk to me. and 3. Get the FUCK away from me. But all of these people were nice, so it was okay. Everyone was impressed with my 40 people. Stephen has the worst laugh I've ever heard, it's 350 times worse than mine. Yep, that bad. I signed up to work during the Working Title concert, since I'm going anyways, and I get in for FREE! Since Luke was my coach guy, he kept trying to give me advise: 'You just gotta keep your head held high. I mean, people are jerks, but don't worry, okay?' I was like, 'I'm really okay.' So I finally left and I was like, 'Thanks for all the help, Luke.' And he starts waving and is like, 'No problem, bye! Have a good day!' Dude, it's 5:30, the day is over.     I babysat this morning. I don't know if anything else is going on. Oh, Anna got an interview with Patrick from Limbeck when we go to see Maxeen in Cleveland. That's super exciting- she loves that kid. I just really love Tom Bailey- he's beautiful. That's about it. BYE!</td>

      <td>It was brought to my attention yesterday that amid ALL of my broken promises to Scott, the biggest, most offensive one was not blogging about my experience at my first tractor pull. I DO apologize and here ya go.  The day before I broke my arm, I attended the Wayne County Fair and watched my first tractor pull. Scott had been telling me to go to a tractor pull for about three years and I just never got it done. Wayne County Fair, here I come. Tractor pulling gets five stars out of five from me. I would have to say that the tractor pull was quite possibly one of the coolest things I have seen in a while. I watched the Busch Pullers, which was the highest level of tractor pulling in NE. These guys have the fire suits, the helmets, and the cages. The whole shebang! There is lots of black smoke and loud noise. Some of the pullers in the Super Stock class had turbine helicopter engines on them. That....to me.....is NOT a tractor, but whatever, it was kind of cool to listen to them. They hum and have a high pitched whine.  With all of that said.....I don't believe that I will be taking up tractor pulling. Granted, it is very cool, I believe that NASCAR is the redneck limit for this city kid. Tractor pulling is like NASCAR for farmers, in a way. I would like to hang out with Scott at a tractor pull, just to see what goes on 'behind the scenes', but I'm pretty sure I'm not giving up my dressage horse. Sorry Scott :)</td>

I do have football practice tonight for two hours but that isnt what I really want to be doing with my summer, ever since school has been out and even while it was going on I have been prepping myself for the upcoming football season and I can't wait for it but all I seem to do now a days is be tired and and lift/condition. My grandparents did come visit last week for a couple of days but we didn't do anything out of the ordinary except eat out at ruby tuesday's on thursday but that wasn't anything new.  Although for not feeling like I am doing alot I have done a good deal of work this summer: mowing 3 yards which consume almost 17 hours of my week, working on our newly aquired land about 5 hours a week ( and all I do is clear brush, weed eat the drive path, and cut up trees ), then I spend sunday mornings and eveninings at church which is fun prolly about at the most 4 1/2 hours a week, and then out side of all that I go to lifting/conditioning for football for about 2 hours every evening. But really it's not that bad because I get paid for the work and the lifting pays off in the end but I want more time for the movies and hanging/partying. Finishing thought right now is : I really want to learn to ride a horse and I cant wait till I can be in ROTC!</td>

      <td>Extreme Makeovers   I've decided that I want to be white.  I want a law that says that I can legally put on any document that asks for my race, that I am white. I don't want to chance anything else about me; I will remain ghetto-fabulous, strainght outta Compton (Tarbabe 4 Life). But I want all of the advantages that come with being white.  Written or not, we all know what those advantages are.   I know that some will argue, 'how can you claim to be white and it's obvious by looking at you that you are not'?  I looked up Webster's definition of 'white', in regards to race, I know that I don't fit the description, so I want the definition changed so that I can have the right to claim that I am white.  It's not like God said 'okay, I'm going to call these people black, those mexican, some asian and some white.  Unlike  marriage , it's a man-made defintion so there shouldn't be a problem making the change.</td>

      <td>I have finish reading the drama yesterday the play is mostly about this young girl Mala, she seems to be traumatize by her childhood memories. She is afraid of men and yet she feels lonely and without attention so she use her body to get attention. At first I blame the mother who kept silence when she should have spoken out, who can’t accept reality and can only pray and hope for help. But as the play unveils I pity the poor mother.I find that all the female character in this play to be weak and are dominated by man maybe it’s the societies fault, where the man lead and the woman follow and where woman are seen but not heard. Mala put the blame on her self. She is incapable to fight back, she knows it’s not her fault but yet she can’t break free of her childhood trauma. She wants attention from man; to her men are the source of pain and pleasure. The lack of attention form her parents made her seeking attention from men, changing her from viewing sex as a source of pain to pleasure. The male characters are mostly bad except for Deepak, again man is seen as the source of pain and pleasure. Deepak is the one that eventually help her to end her childhood trauma, he love her and not her body something that is new and unfamiliar to Mala. 30 days in September I’m looking forward to seeing this play perform, it looks interesting on print and I think I would enjoy it on stage.</td>

      <td>I have never tried to push my religious beliefs on anyone, because God knows Im nowhere near the example of Christianity. But this is story that I think needs to be told.  ----  My Dads best friend while I was growing up was a neighbor of ours that went to the same high school as him. His name was Mike. He was a ladies man, a mans man. In my perspective as a young boy, he was the embodiment of a man. A hard worker, charismatic, everyone who ever meet him instantly fell in love with him.   As I grew older he was always there. He use to go hunting, my brother and my Dad and Mike, and Mike would sit on the tailgate of his truck and tell me these amazing stories of all the mischief he had gotten into when he was younger. We would sit and laugh all night long, back when life was simple.   Mike was a heavy smoker. Whenever you crossed paths with Mile he would always have a Mountain Dew and a cigarette hanging out of his mouth. It was his persona, it added to his character.   Mikes mother had always been active in the small Church of Christ located in the heart of our small community. But for some reason Mike was never a religious man, his life style didn't suit religion.  About two years ago Mike was doing some work around his mothers house, cutting up trees with a chainsaw for fire wood. He slipped and cut his leg and it required some stitches. After a few weeks Mike went back to the hospital to have the stitches taken out, Mike never left the hospital.   Now that I think about it he most have been sick for sometime. But he wasn't the kind of guy to let you know he wasn't feeling right. After they took the stitches out Mike must have told the doctor to run some test. Mike was dying of lung cancer. And his condition went on rapid fire. He went from working in the yard to being on a hospital bed in less than a week.   He was in the ICU for probably a week before we went to see him. He was slipping in and out of a coma, so the doctors would only allow the family to go back and see him. So my Mother and my Sister and I spent the time we were there talking to his family.   After about three hours Mikes mother comes from the ICU crying. Everyone went limp, and somewhere through her sobs she managed to say 'No! No! These are happy tears.'  Mike had woken from a three day coma and said that he wanted to be baptized, and that he wanted my father there. They called my dad at work and within an hour he was there. Everyone else had relocated to the water therapy center, and the preacher had already been there comforting Mikes mother. So I elected to stay and wait on my father.  When my dad got of the elevator I quickly motioned for him to follow me. We raced down the halls of the hospital and made it just in time to watch them lower Mike into the water, and come out as a new man. And now that I think back, that had to be the hardest part for me. Seeing my hero, someone I had always looked up to, so weak with the disease that he couldn't even lift his own arms made me understand the mortality of man.   After the baptism they relocated Mike to a normal hospital room so more people could see him. My father and I walked beside the stretcher and talked to Mike as we made the trip to his new room. Mike was losing his voice, but he ackownledge that he knew my father and I, and I remember him smiling as we talked to him.   When we made it to the new room we all stood around his bed. Me, my father, my sister, my mother, Mikes brother, Mikes mother, and Mikes daughter, and the preacher. He all held hands in a circle and prayed. I thank God that I was graced with the honor to be a part of that moment.   Three days later Mike died. And when we got the call I sat down and started writing. Because sometimes all I can do is just write(maybe sometime I will add what I wrote into here). And I gave it to Mikes mom, just to help her in her time of sorrow.  At Mikes funeral, at the very end, the preacher read what I wrote, and credited me for writing it. There, at that moment, in the remembrance of a great man and our last good-bye, they gave -me- the final statement. That was the most honoring day of my life.</td>

      <td>The Rollercoaster I am on called ComicCon continues to run me ragged. I won't bore you with my true reasons for being here, thats part of my OTHER life, but I will tell you that it is exciting and exhausting to the extreme. I wouldn't trade the opportunity to be here for anything, its that much fun!  First off: Irene is down in DC, but is a winner here in SD as I have not only gotten her a rare NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS item (Kubrick related, of course) but she about to be the proud owner of a personally autographed lithograph by her fave artist, Mr. Michael Turner. I don't know Mr. Turner very well, but I appreciate his going to the extra step to personalize the autograph for my significant other. I think she's gonna be happy...  While working as well as searching for gifts for the nephew, cousin, and girlfriend, I took the opportunity, as I do every year here, to make some time for myself and attend the annual STAR WARS presentation along with 6,999 other people. This is always a highlight, especially when there is a new movie on the horizon. I'll skip over the details, you can always find them on the SW website, but being there for the first announcement of the new movie title, REVENGE OF THE SITH, at the end of the presentation, was something special for a diehard like myself. However, this is just where the fun begins...  Immediately after announcing said title, Steve Sansweet, the Lucas 'guy' who gives these presentations, displayed a new tshirt with the new movie title/logo on it and announced the shirt would be onsale in 'Five minutes at the Star Wars Pavillion' (which is huge, fyi). Well, you dont say that kinda of thing to 7,000 insane fans, who all then RAN, and I mean RAN to get the tshirt. I didnt rush as I had calls to return, but when I made it to the line, there were literally THOUSANDS of people in front of me. In fact, Con security had to cut the line for safety reasons and of course, I was part of the line that was cut. RRRRR.  Frustrated, I went on my way, not realizing I was walking past the back of the pavillion where said shirts were being sold. The securtiy people were so busy forcing people against the wall that they basically left the SW salespeople/cash registered unblocked, so yours truly had no problem walking RIGHT UP and buying a tshirt within 3 minutes and before they even let anyone get there!! In my perverted mind, I am the first person to ever buy a REVENGE shirt, but I know its not true, but ALLOW me the moment, ok? I got lucky here and was so scared that they were gonna bust me that I ran off as soon as I purchased the shirt. Within seconds, someone from Lucasfilm had grabbed me. I was ready to give the shirt back, but it was actually the girl working the register giving me my change!! I was so excited that I split before getting my money. While I am a sith badass for cutting thousands of people on line, she would make an honorable jedi for bringing me my change. Cheers to Lucascashregisterchick.  My other highlight of the evening: While on my way to dinner with a wonderful TV actress who I grew up watching and having a major crush on, I was stung by a bee for the first time in my life. It SUCKED. I don't recommend it. Especially when dining with TV stars. However, it was a great conversation piece, especially when putting a bag of ice on my swelling neck. Fortunately, no allergic reaction. Yet. Pray.  So its back to the Con for a bit tomorrow, then off to LA again for the week. I'm tired, but I have seen the wookie planet and thats enough to make me happy and sleep well.   Goodnight, all!  F</td>

ACK!! can you believe it.  but it was ok- it was actually like 655 so i walked myself to the east gate guard booth and got a temp badge.  good thing i wore FLIPflops today! i had brought a pair of wedge-y sandals to wear but with the walking so far i decided not to. i love casual fridays. i love jeans!  anyway so here i am at my desk.  its going to be a good day. :)  going to do some on-line mandatory ethics training for new hires and be happy.  im seeing will tonight!!!!!</td>

If MirCorp (the company that is in control of Mir) doesn't get 7-10 million dollars (presumably to buy lots and lots of lysol.) within a few weeks, they will have to scrap Mir next February. another problem: NBC is going to have to think up something quick, because they had a new survivor-esque series in the works, wherein the winner gets to go to Mir.

There was an incident on Saturday that I won't go into here, I will say that he thanked us for praying that Hedge of Protection around him and that at that moment he said he felt it, and that it's some pretty strong stuff.  He asked that we keep praying for him, for his guys, to keep them safe so that if another similar situation occurs they are again able to walk away unharmed.  Every letter that Caitlin writes to him she tells him that she prays for a Head of Pertishin around him every night.  Last Tuesday when we talked he said he wasn't sure what that was, and it took him a half hour to sound it out and know what she meant.  Well, be it a Head of Pertishin or a Hedge of Protection, we're pretty certain our guy's head and hedge alike are glowing in the desert over there.  (This is the story I tell Caitlin to make her feel better about him not getting hurt.)  He's going to try to call again tonight or tomorrow.  The line was a thousand men long.  Wives and families across the country jumping to answer the phone today just like I did.  Took my lemon into the shop this morning to get a leak checked, and I decided to nurse it along for a while.

      <td>From The Vatican Information Service:   'In public opinion,' writes the Pope, 'the image of the Inquisition represents in some way the symbol of this counter-witness and scandal. In what measure is this image faithful to reality?  Before asking for forgiveness, it is necessary to know exactly what are the facts and to recognize the shortcomings with respect to the evangelical needs in appropriate cases. This is why the Committee referred to historians whose scientific competence is universally recognized.'  John Paul II recalls that on March 12, 2000, a Day of Forgiveness was celebrated and forgiveness was asked 'for the errors committed in the service of the truth when unethical methods were used.'  This petition for forgiveness 'is also valid for the drama related to the Inquisition as well as the wounds that are its consequence. ... This volume,' he concludes, 'is written in the spirit of this petition for forgiveness.'  Cardinal Cottier indicated that the fact that the volume has been published so late is not due 'to opposition to its publication. I would like to make that clear. The delay is due to a series of health problems.'  Referring to the symposium, in which thirty speakers and experts from Italy, France, Portugal, Malta, England, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Czech Republic, the United States and Canada participated, Prof. Borromeo said they discussed 'the events  that led to the Inquisition in the 13th century, the activity in the main places in which heresy flourished (especially France and Italy) and its procedures. When dealing with the modern history of this institution,' added Borromeo, 'the reports were divided into two categories. One was predominantly geographic (Spain and Portugal with their respective imperial colonies; Italy, with special reference to the Congregation of the Holy Office, the Netherlands and England). The other was mainly thematic: (the repression of the heresies with Jewish and Islamic tendencies, Protestantism and witchcraft were discussed, as well as the battle against circulating prohibited literary and scientific books and Bibles in the vernacular and the historical context in which the abolition of courts took place).'  The acts of the symposium, said Borromeo, 'are a point of reference for studies on the Inquisition; in the first place, for the scientific rigor of the reports, exempt from controversy or an apologetic nature which is typical of recent historiography; in the second place, for the richness of the information laid out which allows us to look at many places so widespread among non-specialists (the use of torture and the death penalty were not as frequent as once believed); in the third place, due to the amplitude of the volume, it is a reason to hope that intellectual debate on the theme is sparked and that there is stimulus for new research.'</td>

But I was kinda hoping for more of a direction to blogging about  Memphis . Let's face it, there's not much in the way of conservative point of view in the Memphis media and print outlets!  I was talking with someone last night and moaning about how there aren't that many bloggers in Memphis (although it's growing), and how so few of those bloggers turn their attention to Memphis and Shelby County.

      <td>My life has been a little strange lately. I had made plans for Friday, also happening to be excited to hang out with a friend that had been gone a week. It was 10:30, and would be a little while before I engaged in social activity. I sat on the couch for a while... decided to do something constructive: write on my blog, and then make an attempt at cleaning the bathroom. Then I returned to the couch.       One friend was babysitting until 2:00, but I was hoping to hang out with second friend a bit before that.  I'll wait 'til 12:00 to call.  And so I did, and she was busy with her family, but would call me when she could hang out. It was a long day of waiting: reading, sleeping, listening to music, I also watched  The Nightmare Before Christmas . I wanted to go on a walk, but reasoned that going on a walk was not worth it if I were to miss a call- that is, any interaction with another person. It rolled around to be 4:00 and I was still on the couch. I also called a third friend, who had gone to a movie, but I called him later He said he would call when we got tired of reading, which he did. It was around 6:00 that Josh, Rick and Jean finally got home, and I was finally off that couch. It was a quarter 'til 8:00pm that I finally stepped outside the door of my house.      The next day I awoke early to be at work at 7:00am. I finished at 6:00pm. Simply said it was a long, hot day standing out with only the driving-by cars and the occasional friendly ticket-taker. My mind ran through circles and maximum-freight trains of thought. It continued to cultivate that new world within my mind that had made much progress the day before.      Come Sunday afternoon, I had a horrible time being social. It just didn't come natural, infact, people annoyed and agitated me.  Obviously they don't understand the rules of the world,  I thought  Or wait, maybe that's the world I've created in my mind during isolation. I'm really not to sure anymore...</td>

This is our path of career, something important in life. But I'm really fed up, really mad with anger. Yet they didn't care at all, 'cause they know, that, in the end, I will still do the work and they don't have to do anything at all.

      <td>Well, I suppose we have to beat England's former colonies before we can beat the big dogs themselves (though last I checked, US was ranked 9th, ahead of England and Italia). But the reason I mention this match is twofold. First, to warn Adam that we're coming for him, just like the Continental soldiers came for the redcoats. Second, one of the announcers yesterday made a terrible comment during the game. But a little background is necessary. Back in the 80s, the US invaded Grenada for some unknown reason (unknown to me, that is). The invasion was brief (Grenadiens number only 90,000) and I believe quite bloody. Probably an effort to put down some coup d'etat or other. But anyway, fast forward to 2004. The commentators during yesterday's match said 'Grenada needs a 4-0 victory to win on aggregate, and they have about as much chance of that as they did in the invasion back in the 80s.' I thought this was in poor taste, and I just wanted to comment on it. It reminded me of something George W. would say over coffee with his Yale mates. Kerry, 2004.

Korea was a tough few months but it got me here, to Taipei and I love it here so I guess Korea was worth it. I am loving my new job ( I know I say that a lot) and I am really looking forward to the start of the school year in August. It's been a long time coming but I am finally feeling settled and like things are moving a long as they should be and it's a great feeling! &amp;nbsp; Okay enough reflecting! I was fortunate enough to get a present from my parents in the mail (it arrived yesterday, perfect timing) and in it was a Costco card, I am now a very happy teacher. I went to Costco last night and spent way to many of my hard earned peenies on treats for me and a new friend. Yes I have a pet, unfortunatley the tailess gecko has perished, I did my best but I guess it was just not meant to be, However I have rescued someone else of the 4 legged variety and she is pretty damn cute! (photos soon) I have a puppy, a very small puppy that was taken away from it's mommy to soon in life. 2 weekends ago I was riding home and this man had puppies for sale on a street corner (I saw him again today), I looked in the box and among the crew of dogs was 2 golden lab puppies, a big beagle puppy, a full grown shiztu and the littlest puppy (alone that is) &amp;nbsp;I have ever seen lying on the bottom of the cardboard box. I picked her up and she was almost lifeless and had quite a bad cough. I paid the dirty old man the money he wanted and took her home in my fanny pack on my bicycle. I wasn't sure if I could keep her but I knew that if I left her there she would die.  &amp;nbsp; She has since been to the vet, he thinks the was only about 5 weeks old, so now she is 7 or so and her cough is gone, all in all she is doing a lot better. I take her to work with me and she stays in the principals apartment (she lives in the building the school is in) and then she gets let out and played with at lunch time and after school. I am still contemplating her long term living situation but I am quite in love with the little thing ( I named her Tai, after Taipei) and you can bring dogs back to Canada from here with no quarentine (sp?) so we'll what happens. The downfall to the dog is that I live in a roof top apartment and there is no elevator so I must walk her down 6 floors to go outside, it's a long hike but I'll survive.  &amp;nbsp; Fuuny moment of the day....this morning I am lounging around my apartment, (luckily for me dressed) and my landlords showedup unannounced.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;They came to fix a leak in the roof which they did but then stayed for hours and cleaned my apartment for me, it was quite wierd. They washed my floors and picked at the plants and told me that they thought they had fixed the leak but we needed to wait for the next rain storm to see for sure. They took my garbage with them and left, it was very strange and I am sure that they are telling there family and friends about the forgeiner who never washes her floors... I have only lived there a week and a bit and they were hardly dirty but it was nice of them none the less. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On that note, those of you have l;ived with me would be amazed at how clean my kitchen is! It's clean all the time and there aren't any dishes on the counter either, maybe a mug int he sink from mornign coffe but that's it. Why? Taipei has a very active insect population and cockroaches here can fly! Since a lot of my apartment is open to the great outdoors I get a variety of 6 legged creatures who like to explore my space and a very clean kitchen gives them less reason to take up residence. Cockroaches do appear evry few days, they fly in and I usually attck them with a shoe or I am feeling like a buddhist trap them and let them go again, they are huge though and have scared me half to death at night&amp;nbsp;as that is when thye tend to flyin the windows, they are about _________________________ big, I am not joking. Ahhhh the wonders of a tropical climate.  &amp;nbsp; Anyway I must be off,I am meeting someone from work for dinner and movie to celebrate my birthday and before I do that I must get home and feed the dog. So I will head back out in to the heat and run home, actually ride home.&amp;nbsp; Hope you are all well and that life in North America (except the odd one of you who is in Korea) is treating you well.  &amp;nbsp; love J &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;</td>

      <td>It's quite lovely to be back to the Prox after a wee hiatus!  I had such fun with Jenny in NYC and my fine flatmates(minus one) in the Hampshire.  So many stories, such little time!  I will be sure to post a link to my pics once I get them uploaded (as well as the pics from The Stills show a loooong time ago).    I must mention the funniest night we had in NYC and that was the night of the Keane (pronounced Keen) show.  We came to find out that it was sold out, but the door guy mentioned a slight chance of some tiks being available come showtime.  So we kicked it in the barski, waiting for some news.  In the mean time, this fella perched on a stool and started strumming his guitar...but the shocking part was his voice.  Seriously, he sounded like Joni Mitchell, enough that I looked around to see where the gal with the microphone was!  I missed the first ditty, but Jenny said that the refrain was a repetition of 'tiny' sung like 'tiiiiiny, tinnnnyyyyy'.  Hee hee, so we started singing 'hold me closer tiny eunuch!' We ended up getting into the Keane show for free and it was sweet, but not as enjoyable as tiny eunuch.  Oh yes, and Jenny and I had a thought.  Now I know most of us read  urlLink 1.21 Gigs  on occasion and one predominant theme (aside from musical thoughts and whinings and the occasional political piece) is the use of vulgar nicknames!  Seriously, they can refer to one another as shit stain and dildo and everyone seems to know the suspect in question by that nickname.   Perhaps Proximity can trump them with vulgar nicknames of our own.....?   Finally, this book called  urlLink Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs  by Chuck Klosterman looks hilarious!  He is apparently a senior writer or editor for Spin Mag and this is his second novel.  I read the exerpt on borders.com and laughed about his emo bit!  Teddy would be a fan....he talks about how there is no true love in the world anymore because of Coldplay and John Cusack.  Very funny and it could be next on my reading list.</td>

I wore an old pair of jeans, and my biggest, baggiest K-State sweatshirt, which is my favorite shirt (this thing is HUGE!!  LOL) but of course, I was only wearing flip-flops... Guess I should have put on some 'real' shoes...LOL Anyway... I don't even want to think about the fact that summer is 2/3 over already... *sigh* Fresh cup of coffee, and my pink fuzzy slippers (they have yellow duckies on them...LOL) and I am starting to feel much better...  I have been reading my 'dailies', no, not the newspaper, my daily Blogs...(listed at right) and I realize that I don't know if I could ever write about our intimate details and not make them sound ridiculous, or pornographic... Or just embarrassing myself...LOL I have never been good about being able to say things out loud... (frustrated Hawke to no end...) I get embarrassed sooo easily... I can watch someone do something stupid on television and it embarrasses   me  !     R has been away for a couple of days due to work, and I am realizing how much I would miss him if we did get divorced. But, when he is here, there are things he does or says that just makes me cringe... I find myself making excuses for him to my family... (my mother, by the way, has been wanting me to leave him since I married him in 1985!) Does everything boil down to how things go in the bedroom? Is fantastic sex enough to keep us together? I do love him... Is that enough? Respect... That I'm not sure is up to par on either side in this relationship... I think it may be the deciding factor...  R is my best friend... The sex is great... Maybe I should just be satisfied with that, right? I just don't want to be stuck in Hick County forever, and he is the kind of guy that has zero ambition... Oh, he has lots of 'One of these days...', and 'I wish...' But not good at all at actually making a goal and working toward it... He has never been taught how to do that, he came from a very sad, abusive childhood, and a pretty rough life after that... He got his GED at 15 and went right to work in the oilfield, where he still works today, (after a short bout as a garbage collector). He has come a long way from the rest of his family... I am very proud of him for that... He needs self-confidence... He needs financial planning help... He spends too much on stupid stuff and doesn't have enough to pay the bills...He needs someone to show him how to set and achieve goals...And I am just no good at it, I guess. I try to help him, but he gets defensive, and walks off... That's his coping mechanism for any arguments we get into... Walking off... He says it's because his father was abusive, and he doesn't want to get to the point that his temper takes over... I guess I can see his point, but as a person who loves a good debate, it is very annoying when he just walks out...  My God, I have been rambling. I congratulate any of you that have made it this far without falling asleep or just closing the window...LOL  I'm really sorry... I just get so 'swirled up' in all these thoughts, I need some form of release...  with the few people around here that I call friends, conversations are like wading around in the shallow end of the pool... I need diving depth once in awhile!!</td>

      <td>CSI FIRES TWO INVESTIGATORS Actors Let Go Due to Salary Demand Dateline: Friday, July 16, 2004 By: Patrick Sauriol News Editor  Source: The Hollywood Reporter, Associated Press, Variety  CSI cast members Jorja Fox and George Eads have been axed from the  top rated television show due to higher salary.  Both were in the  fifth year of the seven contracts and were about to start filming  the first episode of the show's new season when they were dismissed  for breach of contract.  Different news sources are issuing  conflicting reports as to how the dismissal went down, and whether  it was a move by CBS and the show's production partner, Alliance  Atlantis, because letters from the actors weren't received on time  from the actors stating that they would report to the set on time.   Both actors were seeking to increase their paychecks from the show,  and it is known that Eads reported to the set late yesterday.  A  short time afterward Eads received a letter stating that his  services would no longer be required on CSI.  A similar situation happened last year involving cast members of  another hit CBS show, EVERYONE LOVES RAYMOND. In the case of  RAYMOND's actors, the actors were given a raise; with the CSI  situation, Fox and Eads were fired.  The show is now looking to hire two new actors to fill the empty  slots, although it remains unclear whether the new blood will play  the same or different CSI characters.     I am who I say I am and I aM rEalLy, rEalLy uPseT :(</td>

      <td>You can't make this stuff up!  Following is an actual apology note that was mailed to the bartenders at E after a particularily rowdy performance a couple of weeks ago by a girl who at one time was a regular.    Please note:  Her behavior was obviously uncalled for, but culminated in her throwing a beer bottle across the bar which hit the rail, bounced, then came to a smashing finish on the floor.   She was asked to leave immediately.   It wasn't me (I wasn't even there that night).   I've omitted her name, but she signed the note card.   'Wanted to write a note to apologize for my behavior at the bar on Friday. I do not know what came over me and I am not only sorry but embarrassed. I hope that we can forgive and forget and know that it was just a bad moment. Thanks.' I think it's safe to say the guys may forgive her, but I doubt anyone is going to forget this any time soon...</td>

      <td>This is weird. I don't liek the idea of talking to myself but then again I'm currently on my 14th journal....so....yeah.   I'm scaring myself. Lately my poetry has been Kurt Cobain Stylee. He was a great guy, and he mentioned in his journal something like                                                  'all my lyrics are a bunch of contradictions'  I don't want that to happen to my poetry but it may happen. He also didn't make much sense in songs because he just focused on rhyming. ONce again I don't like that. Scary.  I am going to continue writing poems although I am getting a book published. The final number of poems is 177. I will be cutting this number down to 100-150. This is odd. I didn't want a publisher who would be selling a book. I just wanted a publisher who wouldn't ask for much money, who'd just make a copy for me. But now I have an author's contract to sign, 8% royalties (not bad considering I didn't want anything), two free copies of the book, and, well, an achievement. Getting a book published at the age of 16. Wow. I am currently writing a poem called Perfect Girl. Yeah it's a poem about charlie but I don't really care what people think. There is nothing going on  between her. I was going to text her sayign I missed her, but I thought nah. Ellen would see it, and probably tell Andy. Then everyone would think I fancied her. CHarlie said a while ago about when I say I love her, I immediately say something funny afterwards, as if I'm ashamed of telling her I love her. Same goes for the text. I'd text her just sayng 'I miss you' but I'd be scared everyone would take it the wrong way. If I said 'I miss you *sob* lol', then there's humour, and I feel safe. But love is no joke.  I truly do miss her. She has changed the world for me. Or changed me for the world. I don't know.  Pills. All I can say is they suck. After my 4th prescription, the Doctor prescribed me a similar drug, but with less side effects.   It's kinda working. I took my first one yesterday at 9am-ish. All went well till about an hour, then i got pains for about 3 hours non stop. Had a break from them for a few hours, they came back.  I woke up today (WELL DUH! lol) and, um, I missed the dose by about 30 minutes. On any previous prescription I wouldn't be in much pain by then, only 30 minutes late. But all I got today was a sharp pain which lasted even after I took the pill. Just for being 30 minutes late.   The sleeping pills don't work. All I can say on the matter.  Am I becoming dependant on meds?  Peace for now, IlovekurtyIlovecharlieIloveandyIlovemona</td>

Well anyway, she asked me what my reaction would be if she wrote me a letter that said 'I love Ryan' all over it. I told her I would shoot her. I was being sarcastic, obviously. I think she is just trying to get back at me for being gay. I hate her guts, I should have never told her anything.    I have told two people ever, Kym and a girl named Beth. Beth was the reason I stopped dating girls. I hated kissing girls and I knew that if I went out with her I would have to kiss her. Well we got really close, and then my friend Mike showed up in the middle. I was in love with him at the time. At this time I told Beth I was gay, and she decided that sense she couldn't have me she would go out with Mike. She got really close to kissing him but stopped for my sake. She also told Mike I was gay, and Mike told a lot of people. Now I had to deny everything I told her. I also was forced to go out with her to keep her away from Mike. It didn't work out to well, three days after we started going out she cheated on me with Mike. We then broke up the following day.    After that Kym thought that she would try to go out with me. I then told her that I was gay and that I was in love with Ryan. Even though I told her she still wont get over me. Well since she told me that she likes Ryan today, I think I will ignore her. That will make her real mad.   Other than that there isn't that much going on. I helped my dad build a Horseshoe game pit...thing...whatever you call it. It started to rain and I got soaked and really muddy. I don't even like horseshoes, so why are we building it? I guess so we can spend more quality time together, it sounds like so much fun.

My days have been very messed up in terms of schedule... and I am becoming more and more of a night person,  I go to bed after 3am or things like that... and yesterday I wanted to go early since my plan was to wake up early today... so I went to bed and as expected, I just couldn't fall asleep...  so... what to do?... well... to read of course!!!... and I got Lovecraft's book, and so, started reading it... I read one story... and then another one... and then started reading 'the call of cthulhu'...   Good stuff... again It wasn't fear... but they were dark atmospheres... filles with screams, yells and despair... again I wasn't frightened as to throw the book away... but you could say that I was impressed by what was depicted on my mind...  the stuff that was talked about... the rites... the fire... everything...   Anyway... at some point I decided it was enough, and tried to get some sleep again... then is when the fun part started...   I don't really think I was able to sleep at all at night...  I kept thinking of all those things I saw while reading, and to be honest I was a little freaked out... at some point I even felt that someone was sitting in a chair by my bed, and I am not joking... I felt some prescence... and it was all messed up with a weird ambient... like I was half asleep and half awake... honest, I could have been sleeping, and just dreaming of me being awake in a messed up version of my room...  But somehow I got to feel like I was in one of those stories of old... of cthulhu and the ancients...  this story that I was reading before I went to bed talked about dreams, and how in one week of a year a bunch of people had weird dreams... actually just like the one I had... in my 'state of mind' I even got to hear stuff... or feel some mumbling in the air...  like a prayer was being said somewhere far away.... or somewhere very deep in my mind...  All night was like that...   It's not the 1st time something like this happens to me... actually it's very easy that I dream with whatever thing I was doing for a long period of time... magic, a video game... or in this case a book...   The interesting part was that the scene of my 'dream' was my very room... and the ambient was just like the nightmares that were described in the book... I could almost feel like one of the characters that were interviewed by this doctor from the story...  weird... should I stop reading that book at night?...  ...   on the other hand... the day has been rather nice... the only thing that sucks is this kind of headache that has been with me all day...  but I have spent most of the day with hector, since it's his bday, and it's been fun... we both are going through a rather similar stage in our lives... and he's fun to talk to about it, because he actually undestands...   so... FELIZ CUMPLEAOS COMPAERO!!!!...  I am on the messenger with daniel... and I just figured out that I kind of feel like the guy from ende's tale 'the prison of liberty'... he basically has so many choices and doors open, that does nothing because he is afraid of crossing the wrong door... his liberty and the amount of choices in front of him are his own jail... he becomes numb, and does nothing because of fear... argh... I just hope I don't end up like that though...  ... what I am to do?... where will I end up?...   ... canada?... maybe... masters?... nah... not sure yet...  ... honest... if I could just draw and color, and write for a living... wow... that would rock I think...  so... 'ta ta'... cheers my friends...   by the way.... cheers I thing is something that I got from stuart and martin... he he he... my british friends... and it's just a word that I really really like... so... 'cheers!'</td>

      <td>Jeff Jarvis has a  urlLink 'Duh!' moment . It's something that I've been noticing as well, we're not really seeing a campaign  for  Kerry, what we're seeing is a campaign  against  Bush. And really, it's a pretty sad commentary on the state of politics. If the DNC feels that their chosen candidate (Kerry) isn't strong enough to beat Bush on his own merrits, what does that say about Kerry? And they're saying just that by putting fort a campaign that focuses on beating Bush. You could say that de-facto a vote against Bush is a vote for Kerry - but that's a pretty far cry from, 'Vote Kerry, he's the man we want in there.' Instead we have, 'Vote against Bush, because anything is better than what we have now.'   UPDATE:  I just ran across an online advertising that said 'Help make Bush a one-termer' - it was sponsored by the Kerry for President campaign. I followed the link and it was official, but I can't display it because it was a randomly generated ad (which I discovered after I refreshed the page).</td>

      <td>urlLink Utne  magazine (July/August 04) has short piece called ' urlLink Blogging Off ' by Whitney Pastorek (p. 90). A subtitle adds, 'Your blog's great, but can it buy me a beer?' Pastorek is a non-blogger (like me, two days ago) who has discovered her social life suffering from everyone else's use of blogging for their social outlet. She raises good arguments against blogging, but also questions about the purpose of blogging, although she doesn't flesh the questions out. So, perhaps its time to explain my blog intentions further.  I do not intend for this blog to be a social outlet in the purest sense. If I make personal connections based upon shared interests, fine. I still have close friends that I will not expect to read this blog. If they do, fine. If not, fine. Flesh and blood friends are best for sharing wine and  urlLink Scrabble .  In addition to doing this blog for my own entertainment, it would be grand to create a space for readers' reactions to diverse reading experiences. This is where personal book reviews come into my master blog plan. More about reviews later!  I do intend to share book-related experiences, my interests in various subjects and the related resources I've found. I am interested in almost everything I come into contact with, but I choose to delve deeper into some subjects and, for a short time, am a woman obsessed. In these times, I think having this blog will help me organize my thoughts and build a larger inventory of those thoughts and interests. The brain can only be expected to achieve so much!  My only complaint is that the blog structure is so linear, which isn't the way I think. I anticipate lots of links between new and archived posts.</td>

      <td>Juz back from Sunday school. What fun. My friend told me a lot of jokes and i can't stop laughing. Some of the jokes i can say is dirty. But, mostly it is so funny. Lol. I will share with you some of the jokes:-   Little John (Part 1) &amp;nbsp;   One day, Little John came to school. His teacher ask him, 'There are 5 birds on a branch. If you throw a stone at one of them, how many birds will there be at last?' John said, 'None. All the birds will fly away.' The teacher thought for a while and said, 'Hmmm. I like your way of thinking.'   The next day, Little John came to school and ask his teacher a question, 'There are 3 women eating ice-cream, one of them is licking it, the other one is sucking it and the remaining one, biting it. Which one of the women is married?' The teacher thought really hard. At last she said, 'The woman sucking the ice-cream must be married.'   Little John shook his head and said, 'Wrong. The one wearing a wedding ring.' Without pausing he continued to said, 'But I like your way of thinking.'   Little John (Part 2) &amp;nbsp;   One day, Little John carrying a balloon, went out to see his garden. There, he met Sally, his next door neighbour. He teashed her about him having a balloon and she did not. Sally cried and went inside. Minutes later, she came out carrying a bigger balloon. 'Haha, mine balloon is bigger than yours.' Little John was so jealoused that he went back inside.   The next day, Little John rode a blue tricycle to his garden. Again, he met Sally and teased her about riding a bike and she didn't. Sally cried and went inside. Minutes later, she came out riding a pink bicycle. 'Haha, I can already ride on two wheels but you needed three. Little John felt so humiliated that he went back inside.   The next day, Little John came out wearing nothing. Again, he met Sally and said while pointing at his private part, 'I have this and you don't.' Sally didn't cry this time but she came inside for a few minutes naked. She quickly point to her private part while saying, 'I have this and my mummy said that I can have as many&amp;nbsp;as your tail as&amp;nbsp;I want when I grow up.'   There you have it guys. Funny right? Haha. No offence.&amp;nbsp;But, i will&amp;nbsp;tell you more the next time i update. Cya.&amp;nbsp;</td>

We tracked expenses for 3 months, with me buying all the groceries, toiletries, etc.  It averaged out to about $200 difference between what I was paying for misc. stuff and what he was paying for various household expenses.  So now we spend $50 a week on groceries, and I give him $50 a week for expenses, and it works out even.  We've had the 'money talk' a couple of times.  Mainly when he went through periods of little to no work last winter (he's a construction worker).  I was basically supporting the two of us, and it was very stressful.  We sat down, figured out how much we HAD to spend to keep ourselves fed and housed, and that was it.  It was hard, and there was fighting (should we spend extra money going to the movies, buying new PS2 games, or paying extra on the bills?), but we got by.  We figured out what money we needed to spend, what we needed to save, and what we just wanted to buy.  It was during that period that I set up a seperate account just for savings, and started having $10 a week deposited there.</td>

They tried to talk me into a French roll, or Bulkie roll instead, but, I wasn't having it.&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  So, I guess I was destined to not have a good lunch today--I wasn't about to go to a 3rd place.&amp;nbsp; Instead, I had a bowl of Kashi cereal, which I also had for breakfast---its good and all, but not for 2 meals a day. . .and, it didn't quite fill me up like it claims to--I am starving!!!!!!!

      <td>Dear Journal,  Taken from  Reflections on the Art of Living: A Joseph Campbell Companion .        'Have I ever told you about the ritual in Kentucky where I had to give up seven things? It was one of the most interesting group experiences I've ever had. We were a group of about fourty-nine people in one of those meetings of some society for the transformation of consciousness. Two couples from the University of Vermont, professors and their wives, had arranged a ritual that we were all going to undertake. We were divided into seven groups of seven and told to spend a day thinking of the seven things without which we'd not want to live: 'What are the seven things for which you feel your life is worth living?' Then you were to gather seven little objects, small enough to hold in your hand, which were to represent your seven cherished things, and you were to know which was which.        In the evening we went down a wooded road in the dark to the mouth of a cave. The cave had a wooden door on it which could be opened. In front of the door was a man wearing the mask of a dog: Cerberus at the gate of hell. He put his hand out and said, 'Give me that which you least cherish.' When you gave him one of the little objects you were holding, he opened the door and allowed you to enter.        Then you proceeded forward through the cave, an enormous place, holding the six remaining things you most cherished. On five further occasions, you were asked to surrender that which you least cherished, until you were left with one object that represented what you treasured most. And you found out what it was, believe me. You really, really did. And the order in which you gave up your treasures was revelatory: you really knew what your order of values was. Then you came to an exit, where there were two people between whom you had to go. But before you could go through that guarded exit, you had to give up that which you most cherished.        I can tell you that ritual worked. All of the participants with whom I've talked had an actual experience of  moska,  'release,' when they had given up their last treasure. One damned fool was the exception. He did not five up anything. That's how seriously this ritual was taken. When he was asked to give up something, he just stooped down, picked up a pebble, and handed that over. That's the refusal of the call.            ...every failure to cope with a life situation must be laid, in the end, to a restriction of consciousness. Wars and temper tantrums are the makeshifts of ignorance; regrets are illuminations come too late.                The exciting thing to me was the actual experience. It was a feeling of joyous participation. Watching your earlier bondages go really did change your feeling for the treasures you'd given up. It increased your love for them without the tenacity. I was amazed.'   Another most excellent mantra taken from this book:        'Vegetarianism        is the first turning away from life,        because life lives on lives.        Vegetarians are just eating        something that can't run away.    I really enjoy this book!! I can't wait to get to Jung's work! For now I'm taking time to get the boys ready for Joseph's kindergarten orientation while I take time out to dance with them to Jimmy Buffet. Ring around the rosies to 'Escape' and 'If I Said You Had A Beautiful Body' is pretty fun.  With love,  BLG</td>

My titles are usually whatever pops into my head (and lately I haven't bothered to use them at all, at least not always), so I'm not sure if I should have a scheme...? (Unless random counts as a scheme, haha.)  So, about me...I'm 16, a sophomore (soon to be junior! YAY!) at LN where I'm in choir and on the yearbook staff. I'm involved in way too many extracurriculars for my own good -- not that you'd know, because school currently swallows up all of my time! If I'm not stressing out over homework, you can find me online, with friends, or doing something with music. I have an older brother who's a freshman in college (well, technically sophomore, now) and a cat named Harry Potter (NOT Hewlett Packard! :-P). Uh...is that enough? lol  In other news, the choir concert was last night, and it was AMAZING! It was a pops theme (radio hits) and I think it was the best choir show I've been in. All of the choirs had great songs, and the audience seemed to be really into it. It was so exciting! Sad, too, though, because all of the seniors are leaving. *tear*  Well, I'll stop for now.

      <td>For those unfamiliar with them, a weather balloon looks like a balloon with a sheet of tin foil hanging from it. In 1947, any soldier would have no problem identifying one, especially in Roswell, NM. There, they were launched everyday by the army. One July, a high ranking army official investigated the site of one that had crashed and somehow had mistaken it for a weather balloon. --Of course, the rest is history. Why such a fuss over a weather balloon? Let's suppose for a moment that the army was testing a top secret weapon in the New Mexico desert and it crashed in the desert. That would explain the obvious cover-up. But surely anything that was top secret in 1947 would be obsolete technology today. It is policy to release government documents and files concerning such secret weapons of the past.  Then why hasn't the government come clean?  The Roswell Incident was the first step in a process of desensitization. Over the years, the world has been gradually desensitized to the idea of an alien presence through abductions, sightings, crop circles, etc. But still, many refuse to accept the reality. There are others who neither deny nor accept. They ask simply 'Why?'  No, Virginia, Santa is a Big Fat Fake.   Scenario: It is a turbulent time in history. Fear of nuclear war has gripped the nation and at the same time a secret government agency is operating under it's own authority. These select few are the ones that have been chosen to 'deal' with matter concerning an alien presence, whom they are in constant contact with, and to keep it a secret from the rest of the world until they determine when not to. The President at the time is a man who feels this is information the world deserves to know. He plans to tell the public of this. The secret government cannot have this. The President is assassinated.  It all happened. Almost everyone knows about it but few know the whole story. It is referred to as the Kennedy Assassination. It would have remained a mystery if it weren't for the work of Bill Cooper. Mr. Cooper worked for the military and had Top Secret MAJC security clearance (higher than Top Secret). He felt this was information people needed to know. It felt he was risking his life by talking about it. Today, he lectures on the subject of JFK and the government's involvement with alien intelligence.  So why did they have to kill Kennedy? To come on television one night and say, 'Good evening, this is your President. I'm here tonight to tell you that we are not alone in the universe. Aliens form outer space are among us. Goodnight and God bless America' would have caused mass hysteria and collapse of social institutions. This was not in the best interest of the public, according to MJ-12. An equivalent bombshell would be telling a child, 'Santa is dead, the immaculate conception was actually performed by aliens, and don't put money on the Easter Bunny being real, either.'  Little Grey Men and a Cosmic Toilet Bowl  Ancient Chinese Curse - 'May you live in interesting times.' Boy, those ancient Chinese dudes were right about EVERYTHING! The twentieth century is by far the most interesting time period in all of history...and it's not over yet. In man's past, the coming of a new millennia has often caused great anxiety, and for good reason. But what happened in the past is of little importance when compared to what is about to happen in the next few years. The Earth and humanity is about to undergo a transformation. This will be both a physical and spiritual change brought about by a pole shift. Every 4,000 years, the Earth's rotation stops, the continents are shooken up, and the poles change location. This is caused by a 12th planet in our solar system on a ~4,000 year elliptical orbit around the sun. The planet is huge and is pulling with great force on the Earth as you read this, causing the great increase in earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, etc. by heating the Earth's core. This may sound extremely farfetched to some. But the proof is out there, it only need be heard. Take for instance the puzzling crop circles (and sand circles, snow circles, and ice circles). Perfect geometric patterns in fields of wheat - hundreds of meters longs with wheat woven, not broken. What is more extraordinary is that there are magnetic differences in the regions where these circles are formed. And even more, a few inches beneath the ground, the earth is scorched.  The term 'circle' isn't even accurate any more. For having started out as circles, the designs have now evolved into complex geometric patterns. Such designs would take a team of men a whole day to construct one. But in the dark of night? Without a sound? Without footprints? Without breaking a single shaft? But how would they fake identical patterns in snow without leaving footprints? Or on frozen lakes with ice less than an inch thick?  These are the questions that crop circles are meant to raise. Furthermore, they speak to our subconscious. In a recent circle, the solar system is depicted, with the Earth's orbit missing. There is so much that I could explain here, but I'd best leave that to the expert, Nancy. If you haven't already, visit her web page zetatalk and read more about it. But what is essential to know is that this impending catastrophe is part of the Earth's 'plan'. For in times of natural disasters, people are at their best. They do as much as possible to help others, thinking of others first and themselves last. Right now, humankind is at a crossroads. The problems of overpopulation, AIDS, pollution, etc. are out of the hands of man. There is little that can be done to solve these problems of the modern world. But soon, humanity will be 'born again' into a new Earth, a new spiritual density - flushing the cosmic toilet, so to speak. This is part of the evolution of humankind. That is why the Zetas are here. They are helping us prepare for what is coming.  It would be easy to dismiss this as nonsense and go about our lives, laughing at such an idea. It would be convenient to say that the people saying these things and the people who claim to be abducted by aliens are crazy, looney. And that is what so many people have been doing. The first stage is denial. If one were to look at all the facts, it would be clear that what has been said is true. And when one does that, they become scared. Right now there's a whole generation of scared young people who see no hope for their future. What they do not know is that they will either perish in the pole shift or survive and live in the Aftertime - the new Earth. For those people who have had to deal with this issue of the pole shift, particularly the contactees, a common part of the process is depression. Anyone who has suffered from this 'pre-distressed' state will tell you that they wish that - with all their hearts - all that they believed about the future was not true. They wish there was something out there to convince them 'that everything was going to be OK'. But that is not the case. If they find a way to deal with their depression (with therapy, antidepressants, etc) they come to the final stage - acceptance. They accept their future with an attitude that they can and will survive.  This is exactly what this page is about. And it's more than just a web page. Web pages are an excellent method of communication, as is the Internet as a whole. Aftertime Generation is a community of concerned, intelligent individuals. We are not wackos. No one should feel that they are crazy for believing in something they see to be true. You have two choices: you can either not believe it or believe it. For those that do believe, understand that you are not alone. There are thousands of people from all walks of life that have the same beliefs as yourself. For those who think that Aftertime Generation is a bunch of bullshit, I respect your opinions and your beliefs. And I appreciate you respecting mine. After all, you wouldn't harass or criticize someone who believed in God would you? I know I wouldn't. I understand what it means to believe in something without any substantial evidence. Many of my own beliefs are like that, it's just that I have evidence backing up one of them. Aftertime Generation is a web page specifically for young adults. It is here for the sole purpose of communicating a supportive atmosphere and creating a community of like-minded people through the bandwidth.  -M.G. aka Pioneer</td>

The good news is that the lead players in the music industry have all fucked up to the tune of millions of dollars and still managed to hang in there and thrive. Some shitty melbourne band booker trying to save his own arse and blasting you in the process don't mean nuthin. He's probably more pissed off at himself for not doing his job properly. Also, store his name in your memory. One day he'll come crawling to you for a favour and you'll be able to deal with him in kind. Some call it Karma, it certainly all goes around and comes around.   I'm pretty much known for my dire forecasts and diagnosis of the music industry, but if anyone here takes more than a passing interest in the mechanics of the beast take heart from the charts this week. John Butler Trio is a shining and prominent example of how you need not work within the old, outdated framework of the industry establishment in order to achieve sucess and have a fruitful and artistically rewarding career.   JBTrio funded their first album and have funded their own recordings ever since, which they put out through an independant distributor. This means that, not only do they have no label to answer to commercially or atristically, but they personally pocket $10 from every album sold (Compared to the $1.70 industry average). The major way they market their music is by extensive touring, which they profit greatly from anyway. They keep their overheads low and don't spend money unneccisarily on mainstream advertising and marketing campaigns. They built up the reputation and popularity of their act over several years, having then patience not to ever try and hype their way into everyone's conciesness. Their label mates, 'The Waifs' have followed a similar career path, with fans all over the globe and very profitable concert tours.  This week John Butler Trio debuted #1 on the Australian Charts with their new album 'Sunrise Over Sea', selling a massive 25,000 units in only it's first week of release. This is an amazing achievement for an independant act and a level of success and profitability that Australia's major labels can only dream and hopefully aspire to. In reality the success of JBT should be a massive fucking wake-up call to the majors.   It should spell out that the days of signing some act just because everyone else wants it, while having no vision for the act nor any idea of how to develop it other than to throw huge bundles of cash around and hope that something sticks are over. That spending more on marketing and the paychecks for outdated, dinosaur execs than on development is stupid. That signing acts that will do well with 14 year old girls for about a month before dissapearing is short-sighted and ultimately unprofitable. That signing acts that simply ape what was popular six months ago is not progressive, imaginative or very smart. That the internet was the most exciting music delivery system to emerge in 1996 and that being eight years behind such a crucial technology and failing to see it's potential is unforgiveable and incredibly fucking incompetent. That bitching, whining and sueing fans now that the downloading horse has bolted is pointless. That telecommunications companies are acting more efficiently as record companies with their ringtones then the actual companies are. That their days are numbered and and unless they repent and change they will eventually dissapear to be replaced by a system that is more efficient and kinder to artists and fans.  I'll now quietly step off my soapbox...</td>

      <td>As of last week, about 1,600 Americans have been trapped in the labyrinth of the U.S. legal system by a body that, though it has no public accountability, has established itself as a quasi-governmental authority. Torn away from their lives, they face massive fines, court costs, and even imprisonment. Were these people terrorists? Pedophiles? Hapless under-employed twenty-somethings who had defaulted on their student loans? Nope: They were ordinary computer users charged by the Recording Industry of America with violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  While it was  urlLink originally instituted in 1998 as part of the hardly publicly-minded World Trade Organization's mandates for member countries , the DMCA is one step closer to actually handing the country over to corporate rule. (Lest we forget, the government is currently the sole property of  urlLink Halliburton .) For instance, the Act gives the recording industry, which is a trade group and not something that anyone actually voted on, essentially Gestapo-like powers. Rather than the subpoena being given by an actual judge, it can be issued by the clerk of a United States District Court upon reasonable suspicion that you're hooked up to a peer-to-peer network such as WinMX or KaZaA. Bamyour ISP has to provide all your information, including your name, address, telephone number, shoe size, and whether or not you wank to the girls jumping on trampolines during the 'Man Show' credits. And, if they find any music files after they confiscate your hard drive, you'll most likely be their indentured servant for the rest of your natural life, with a large chunk of your wages garnished to pay off the 'damages.' For a trade group to wield that kind of influence is ridiculous. Hell, Ralph Nader wishes he had that kind of pull.  Moreover, the entire argument that the recording industry uses to defend its actionsthat it protects artists' rightsis patently ridiculous. Music today is an industry; songs and 'artists' are manufactured the way Andy Warhol manufactured silkscreens and the Velvet Underground. To suggest that Creed or Avril Lavigne or Justin Timberlake or some other assembly-line device for branding sound is having the fruits of their labors ripped off by file-swapping script kiddies is like suggesting that Milli Vanilli is getting ripped off every time someone fires up a karaoke machine. Through the magic of marketing, the recording industry has made something otherwise worthless into a precious commodity, restricted public access to it by making the prices ridiculously high (have you seen what they're charging for CDs these days?!), and then screaming bloody murder when a black market develops.  What the RIAA is really afraid of is that file sharing is destroying this little racket they've got going. Historically, the recording industry got huge at the same time that people moved from the shoulder-to-shoulder crowding cities to the bland anonymity of the suburbslimiting their access to live music venues and other sources of authentic culture, but opening the door for the culture-manufacturing industry to step in and provide us with an amazing simulation thereof, just the same way that Wonder Bread and Spam are amazing simulations of actual food. What the Internet has done is digitally reconnect us into communities, short-circuiting the means of marketing, manufacture, and distribution that the powers that be have invested so much in.  The RIAA, a dinosaur if there ever was one, knows it's fighting a losing battle against the forces of evolution. Sure, CD sales have declined, but when you consider the lawyers' fees and work hours necessary to indict, convict, and fine even a tiny portion of the people who are swapping files, they're just throwing good money after bad. Like the vicious dog in your neighbor's fenced-in yard, the RIAA is dangerous, but sufficiently remote not to be worrisome to the vast majority of people. And they know it: Take, for example, their recent motions towards  urlLink persuading Congress that P2P networks are a one-stop source for computer viruses and kiddie porn . Next thing they'll do is require you to pay royalties if you get a song stuck in your head or you sing 'Happy Birthday' at someone's party. (Someone actually owns the rights to 'Happy Birthday,' you know.)  What's even more wrong is for a private entity to hijack the courts and ruin the lives of a small portion of the people who are threatening its imagined hegemony. The way to stop it is by the power of the purse. I, for one,  urlLink will not buy another freaking CD put out by a major label  until the charges against every one of the people indicted under the DCMA are dropped. Maybe then they'll finally shut the fuck up and die.  (Incidentally, I, personally, don't use peer-to-peer networks, simply because what's out there is crap. Do a search for some of the people who've authored half the mp3s on my hard drive, and you're going to get zilch. People made music for millennia before Thomas Edison ever made a wax cylinder, and the survivors huddled in the ruins of our current civilization will continue doing it, at least until the toxic zombies eat their brains. And if I ever meet Lou Reed or Jello Biafra, I'll be sure to slip them a twenty for whatever transgressions the Internet community at large has committed.)  Disco sucks.</td>

      <td>So I'm a little behind but at least it's not a double post again!  Update for 4/23/04 I got to do a 30 minute run tonight in Franklin just before I watched our poor company softball team lose again.  I learned a couple things about Franklin and running in Franklin.  Apparently people in Franklin don't take too kindly to outsiders and runners, of which I was both.  With that said, there seemed to be no end to an odd stream rednecks in Mustangs yelling such pithy, original sayings as, 'Run faster boy!' 'Wanna lift, your going awful slow?' 'Run Forest Run!' and the obligatory 'Woohoo!' (yelled by redneck girls as they drove by).  These statements, combined with knee soreness that has escalated in my mind to 'concerning, gave me a lesser view of two groups of people:  1) People from Franklin.  2) People in Mustangs.  (Sorry if anyone on this list fits into those categories, but you can blame the white trash that was yelling out their windows at me on Friday)  All in all, the run was good.  I monitored my knee pain/soreness throughout the run.  It didn't get worse but didn't get much better.  Most of Franklin was flat, but there is one hill and I took a random turn down a road to end up running up the worst part of it.  I say worst part, but the stairclimber training helped me to kick that hill's butt!</td>

      <td>Ever notice how a smell can dredge up some of the craziest or strangest of memories? I have read before that odour memory falls off less rapidly than any other sensory memory such as taste, or touch. perfume companies make millions a year because of our sense of smell. I know I am not the only one that will pass by someone in a store, and have them remind me of an ex because of the same cologne being used. or the smell of someones hair on a pillow. As weird as this is, the smell of morning breath, sometimes not being entirely pleasant, however, there is something comfortable in someones morning breath,someone you love. Turning over in the morning, feeling that warmth against your cheek, and inhaling that musky deep scent as it dances on your face. Everyone has their own scent.  enough of that. In these futile days of hopeless attitudes, beaten dreams, and greedy hearts, in these days when no one asks why and just goes with whatever, in order to save time or save effort, I feel lost. I feel misplaced. Why? Because I refuse to believe this is as good as it is going to get. That this is as good as i will get, or my life as a whole, or this world as a whole. I refuse to believe that my actions or presense here has no effect on anything or anyone around me because I am not everything I had once thought I would be. There is a darkness around us now. A haze that has trapped us in this pudding like pool of hopelessness and defeat. People settle for the easiest choices. Once more I will state this...EASY IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER!!!!! So what if I am the living definition of overly sensitive and emotional. I feel things others don't seem to. I see that person sitting at their desk, thinking no one notices the downcast eyebrows, or the worry running rampant in their eyes. I feel their grief, their anxiety, their troubled hearts. Maybe it is just me thinking of how I feel when I look like that, I have the worst poker face in the world. Yet I feel in tune with every emotion everyone feels. I feel that sadness, i feel sad when i feel that persons hatred or anger. I feel when someone is in love, and I even get jealous of that. I wish sometimes I had a shield I could put up so that those emotions didnt swarm to me and fill me with everyone elses troubles. But that is who I am.  Because of that I am able to be there for others, to be able to be honestly caring and empathetic to everyones needs. Next time you are around someone take the moment to really look at them. really look at someone next time you do something for them or say something to them. remember that they are a person and have their own thoughts and feelings, and you have an impact, even if it is small, on their day. and it spirals from there. Do you want to impact the world in a good or bad way? it all starts with what you do or say to that one person.  Some think I am too nice, and yes, maybe in the world we live in now, i would be considered too polite and nice, but hey, I believe that I was put here to stand for the truth and give the love that is in me, that feels so often as though it will swallow me whole because I cant get it out enough.I feel that somehow this crazy disease i have of loving too much and feeling too much will bring light through this darkness around us now and enlighten the path for many people to that place where hope is found. next subject isnt it odd how some of the smartest people are idiots. a person could have graduated top of their class from harvard, yet be the biggest idiot you will ever meet because of their actions toward others.  random thought time:) too many realizations today about how i have treated things and allowed myself to get caught up with things that were obvious to everyone but me that they were not what I had planned them to be and that I was the only one still caught up in it all. too long a story to get into, but some words of advice. sometimes you have to bite the bullet and let go. figure out if it is the fantasy you are holding on to or something real that can and will happen. I can honestly say there is only one person in this world that I think I have not brought good into their lives. I feel that I have brought something good to others and made their lives somewhat better, only one person does it seem like that wasnt affected positively, or at least wont admit to it, and I think that is why it has been so hard for me to be ok with how things are between us. it is not the best feeling knowing that someone seems more unhappy because you were in their life. I dont know why or what it was. see, i am the kind of person that is the same with everyone. sometimes some people will act differently with others, I am the same me with everyone, silly, sweet, fun, honest, totally me. and i think that bothers some people, bothers them because they cant be that way. some people are like bad chocolate cake. you first taste the sweet icing, wonderful, tasty, but you get to the inside after savoring the frosting and you find it to be dry, crumbly, and sour, and you try to eat bites of it with frosting, yet the sourness still surfaces and makes you gag.  some people are different. some have less than yummy icing but after that they have sweet, moist cake inside that makes you forget that the icing was dry and flaky. blah blah blah right:) enough for now. a war is going on inside me. ever have that inside voice scream to you 'what are you doing' 'why are you doing this' 'this isnt how it has to be' well...mine does it more than ever lately.</td>

      <td>You stare around you and you start to notice things things, when an enviroment changes people are usuallytaken aback but are easily reconciled with what they cannot change. It hurts no one. Sometimes you look deeper and you realise, people change. You cannot stop it, you can only stand and watch. There are those whom you liked for what they were, when change happens to fast or you are suddenly shakened, and wake to a totally different person, you are left to stand and wonder why?  A person is liked or admired for his qualities but not only is it just that, unknowingly you make certain bonds, links with that perosn and you cannot alter that, when he/she changes and suddenly drives you away more often then not u are left hurt and broken. People are the what makes most things live. Simple words could bring a depressed man away from the buildings edge, but those same words could stab a man so badly he rather die then fight to live.  A person broken by another is a person no longer. He becomes an empty shell, with mind but no love, no feelings, no emotions, the anithesis of passion he becomes more than dead. For what good is living without actually enjoying the bliss, not feeling the pain, to live is for a greter purpose never just to amble through life and do nothing.  Every person, every body has done something for the rest of us, for himself except perhaps he may have done in a small way, you not proof gravity, heal the sick or donate millions to charity. The simple words or a kind gesture of understanding of believe or inspiration or the life you lead yourself can change a person heart or his destiny. If you chose not to live do not obstruct anothers way, let him breathe and be exulted by the change from sky blue to the black of velvet.  A persons words can drive through anothers heart, thing before you say, some words may seam sharp but pierce only the skin but the simplest words or actions are usaully the most hateful. Without hate there is no love, and without love there can be no life, it slips past your fingers but that feeling of love is forever, the most stoned person would be melted to feel love. The things we cannot understand is usually the greatest of things. We were not meant to understand all.  The general believe would make out the world to sound in choas but i know that it is not true. After all when the soldiers were going to war and knew they would likely not return did they make calls of hatred and revenge? I believe it were all messages of love.  Let love rest in your heart,  love to you all,</td>

Somewhere amongst my blogs is a woeful tale of the Big Crash that killed the drivers for it. I meant to fix them after it happened but well, then I bought a digital camera and just played with that instead. Now the digital cam is tucked away and I want my cam back up for various reason. One of them being I can keep an eye on the place while I'm at work. Every now and then Spooky wanders in front of the camera and sniffs it which makes for amusing views.   I've only got one week left of staying home one day a week and working. Poo. I swear they're sending the kids back earlier and earlier every year. She goes back on the 20th - nearly 2 weeks before labour day. The pools aren't even shut that early. Ah well. Will have to psych myself up for it again. I love my job, I really do. I think my biggest issue is having to get up at 6am. Morning person? Me? No way. I'm not fully awake til at least 10am and even that that's stretching it. I am definitely a night person.  Not much to report right now. I've got to do laundry and tidy the place up but have I done any of that? Nope. Must add 'stop procrastinating' to my to-do list. I'll bet anything though that the mood will strike me at about 9pm to hoover or something. Laundry is best done on Sunday anyway. Everyone in the building is in church so the machines are free :) Anyway, I'm boring myself with this entry so I can imagine what it must be like for anyone reading it.</td>

I keep wondering what I'm doing exactly, has there been a point to all this? My life, I mean. I really should stop feeling sorry for myself, it doesn't really help anything. I've got dinner with Alice tomorrow night then a little birthday party Thursday afternoon. Fun, right? Should be...  About an hour ago I drank an entire pot of coffee and then went out in the dark to powerwash my house. My mum thinks I'm an idiot and I think one of my neighbors may have called the police. Did I mention this was an industrial strength powerwasher? Very, very loud. So that probably wasn't one of my best idea's. I was supposed to do that this morning but I was too busy sleeping. I'm re-painting a section of our house, the toolshed, and the shop this weekend. I hate painting buildings so my parents have decided this is entirely my job. Thanks mucho parental units...  One of my neighbors lost his dog a few days ago. He is, of course, very upset. I understand completely. That did not give him the right to accuse me though. No wait, not me, the 'syphilitic gang of rabbits' I unleashed on our neighborhood is what apparently abducted and murdered his dog. I kid you not. First of all, what the fuck? Second, I have TWO rabbits, they are fixed, live in my house, and do not have syphilis. What's more, they're RABBITS, I don't think they're capable of killing a 120Lb dog or 'abducting' one for that matter. This guy may be more insane then I am. I think we should be best friends...  Oh hold on here, my mum just made me another pot of coffee. Lady, you don't know what you're getting yourself into. I'm going to drink it and run around outside for a few hours. :)</td>

      <td>Everything's Just Beachy    Tropical Sister Chicks Day 2!!  This morning Karon and I dropped Ked off at work and with picnic lunches and sunscreen in tow we headed for the beach! We went to Fort DeSoto beach rated by someone nicknamed 'Mr. Beach' as the 2nd best beach in the U.S. for 2003 right behind a beach in Hawaii. It was a beautiful day in the low 80's with the perfect mix of sunshine, clouds, and light breeze. The beach was sandy white and well maintained. The water was chilly at first, feeling like Lake Michigan in July. We arrived around 10 a.m. and had the beach mostly to ourselves. By noon the area had started to fill up but was far from crowded. We started to walk the beach and in addition to seeing a tiny 1/2 inch crab we saw various shells and lots of sand dollar pieces. I said to Karon, I bet if we walk out there a little we'd find whole sand dollars. Not long after that we saw a lady walking with a handful of sand dollars and she said people were finding them out where I thought we would. So Karon and I waded out about thigh deep and started walking. We ended up getting totally drenched thanks to the waves and bending over to pickup our treasures. We walked away with 15 very cool sand dollars and some of the largest shells I've ever picked up on a beach. I found one sweet shell and was all excited until I pulled it out of the water and realized it was still alive!! Some black squishy mussel was opening and closing his mouth in protest to being picked up. I tossed him back. We had a great time relaxing and enjoying the great outdoors.  We came home after picking up Ked and decided to finish what we started last night. Karon added a few more blonde chunks to her hair and then Amelia got her blonde highlights. So much sun &amp; fun!!  Tomorrow we're going to check out another beach!!</td>

Pinto says:  what is that supposed to mean?  George Harrison says:  the mature choice of action would be to set in motion the cleaning up of your house yourself, instead of just moaning and whining about it to them and every first, second and third person that comes to your house.  Pinto says:  I'm talking about what you said about my family's motivation.  Pinto says:  what the fuck did you fucking mean by that?  Pinto says:  you have no fucking right to talk about MY family's motivation, when you can't even get off your fucking ass to go make an appointment for your N test!  George Harrison says:  that's because I haven't even completed my driving lessons.  George Harrison says:  I don't know when they're going to be done, do I?  George Harrison says:  I'll make my N appointment when I'm ready.  Pinto says:  now, my family is on Welfare, but my sister has gone to more job interviews in the past week than you have in your fucking life!&amp;nbsp; and my mom is goddamn UNABLE TO WORK!!!!!

Pinto says:  the only time yours has been touched in the past month is when I did it!  Pinto says:  DON'T FUCKING TELL ME I'M IMMATURE!  George Harrison says:  fine, if you're going to be that way, I'm not going to talk about it anymore.&amp;nbsp; I have to go paint. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; You should have made sure you had more proof before accusing ME of being immature, Geoff, because on that front I ain't got NOTHING on you!</td>

      <td>New York Citys Tower of Babel     To see the mostly silly, but not all so, World Trade Center designs, check out the  urlLink Lower Manahattan Development Corporations site  and click away.    Without jumping all over the place (The LMDC has enough links and interactive shit to make you not come back to my site) let me tell you that former Mayor Rudy Giuliani doesnt think too highly of the plans. If you couldnt tell by now, neither do I. Does this mean Ill be mayor of New York someday?     The biggest problem I have with most of the projects is their desire to build higher than the previous towers, and in several instances, the tallest buildings in the world. I hardly expect anyone to fly any planes into the towers anytime soon, but    1. How many people really want to be up that high on that site? and    2. The original twin towers were much maligned when they were built for being so high. Disregard most peoples professed love for the towers, they were long despised.    The following paragraphs are just my cap of the projects.  urlLink Click here  and you can skip to where the discussion starts up again.  ***  Probably the plan I disagree with the most comes from the team headed by Richard Meier. Maybe its because I had to study a home he designed, which I liked, for Design III and then design an addition to it. But it just doesnt fit into the city, any city for that matter.    One of the designs I like the best is by Think, which includes the architect behind the much maligned Kimmel Center in Philadelphia. This is where I backtrack and get all confusing. This team is one of those who is pushing for the worlds tallest building. But to their credit there is actual city planning involved. They include a park, which plenty of other designers do, but a park doesnt just attract people. Included is retail space, a library, theater, transit hub ... Everything to keep an area alive from dawn to dawn. And just as important, the design is interesting.    The SOM-led team proposes buildings that sit off-center, as in the dont go straight up. For ground zero, maybe not the best of ideas. But the plan pushes sustainable design - energy efficiency, water recycling, etc.    Foster also proposes the tallest buildings in the world, but he adds the green architecture slant and discusses a city transit hub, simply for my sake. Despite how precarious they may look, its one of the more interesting design concepts. And it certainly isnt the phallic symbol he erected in Great Britain.    The Peterson team designs from an urban planning standpoint, which is nice, but they also propose very tall buildings.    Daniel Libeskind certainly has a way with designing memorials; he designed the Jewish Museum in Berlin. He proposed some of the tallest buildings in the world, but the grouping of the buildings, each jutting up further, rather that 2 monoliths without procession, make the design much more to my liking, maybe other peoples as well. His introduction and slides deal little with sustainable design, something that cannot be overlooked in todays designs.    The last design is by a team called United Architects and they certainly are. The list of members runs on and on. Their design pushes safety, but it does so with the tallest building in the world.     So now back  to the meat and potatoes of the post.    The world of architecture is moving beyond the race to the sky. Most skyscrapers being built now - and have been completed recently - wont place in the Top 20 tallest list. And when a buildings height is significant, its because the city where it is going up is short-statured - like Philadelphia. The Robert Stern building proposed will be tall, but Philly really only has 4 buildings to contend with. This new one will make 5.    As for my height problem, I don't think we need to bow to the terrorist threat, but it's possible to stand up, just not stand the tallest. You also have to take into consideration people will be working on those floors that took the brunt of the crashes. Regardless of how safe anyone calls their building, when workers step onto the floor numbers that took the plane hit, do you think business will be on their mind?    Skyscrapers certainly arent going anywhere anytime soon, but like the iMac, its time for the skyscraper 2. Height has already been conquered, how about now making up for what was lacking, rather than having a pissing contest. Rather than racing to the sky, which now has the added cost of skyrocketing insurance, architecture should be working on weaving their buildings into the city and focusing on efficiency, something skyscrapers have not been known to do.    But thats the ego behind it. The skyscraper almost always stands out and it footprint takes up an entire city block, which requires demolition and displacement. Hardly friendly. They also serve little purpose to protecting people on the street. Look at some older buildings with awnings and overhangs providing this protection.    Fortunately for New York City, a number of the plans take the urban experience and build on it, but how successful will they be?    As I mentioned with Thinks design, a site needs uses beyond offices and retail. Those all have hours of operation that, when closed, vacate an area and create dead space. The nature of a memorial will bring in additional people after hours; An amphitheater and library bolsters that space.    Mixed use is the way to go for success. This and sustainable design were major program requirements for the design teams, yet many of the teams mentioned this as an afterthought in their introductions.    Another aspect to Lower Manhattan comes into question. The LMDC specified 10 million square feet of office space, about what existed in the original structures.    But does New York need that much?    A  urlLink study by Plymouth Partners , which calls itself a brokerage &amp; tenant representative (?), found Manhattans vacancy rate - unrented, but available office space - doubled from 5.1% in 2000 to 10.9% by Sept. 10, 2001. Notice this number is unaffected by the attacks. It ticked up even higher to 11.6% by the end of that year.    Certainly New York City will swing back in action, but theres plenty of available office space throughout the rest of the city that the new tower plans could be scaled back some.    New York City has also been known for largely unflattering buildings of late. Aside from the twin towers - which had the distinction of being the tallest - what buildings, post-1960s, really draw attention like the Chrysler, Citicorp or Empire State buildings?    Which design is picked, and a few should easily make the final decision difficult, New York City could be back in whatever saddle it was in before. It also has the opportunity to go above and beyond, reinvent itself and once again earn it's reputation rather than banking on the old. Count how many bad cliches I used today and win a prize!</td>

      <td>another boredom habit.. looking at people's pages on friendster.. i found an account named 'weHATEavrilFANs'.. this was her profile:     Occupation:   REAL Rakistas   Location:   Philippines   Interests:   Why do I care? Because Avril Lavigne is nothing but a stuck up little bitch. This girl's attitude is shit and not to mention she can't sing worth a shit either. I'm so sick of her.   Affiliations:   Real rock bands who really worked hard to get where they are today not like that poser who used punk as a fucking trend!   Companies:   They think that just because I wear black eyeliner and rubber bracelets that I'm trying to be Avril.   Schools:   Anti-Avril Academy   Favorite Music:   She is a no talent idiot..real Aggresive Punk Rock   Favorite Books:   Go Back to Canada Poser Bitch.     About Me:   I made this place because im sick off being labeled as her i meanjust because i wear chucks,spikes,warmers and eyeliner doesnt mean a like her than fucking bitch has done enough damage to the punk scene.    Another reason why I hate Avril Lavigne is because she is a full blown bitch. She constantly disses &amp;quot;preps,&amp;quot; and I quote &amp;quot;after my shows all these loser preps come up to me and ask me for my autograph, i want to be like 'my music is not for you!'&amp;quot; Thank you to the queen of stereotypes! Jeez, what a bitch. If I had fans I would be grateful for them no matter what kind of person they are. These are the people supporting her, buying her CDs, and buying tickets to see her shows, then she goes and disses them like that. She needs to get a fucking reality check on who she is.     Why am I grateful I'm not an Avril fan? It's simple. They're stupid. Didn't I tell you it was simple? But allow me to digress...     Look at the hatemail I've gotten. It's become clear to me that Avril fans have low grammatical skills, and couldn't come up with an original point of why Avril 'rawks hawrd' if their pathetic, seemingly worthless lives depended on it. The only facts I've gotten of why Avril supposedly &amp;quot;rawks&amp;quot; is that she's hot, she makes a lot of money, she's famous, and that she has talent. Okay. But what about her talent? What makes her any different from the 309823049283402380 other here-and-gone jaded pop stars? The only thing that sets her apart is because she's decided to take a ridiculed label and make it &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot;. As for looks, if you like disgruntled trash, I suppose she would be fairly attractive. I'll admit. I used to think Avril was pretty. I know all the words to Complicated. But I was going bandwagon for only a week or two, tops. When I learnt more about our favorite posergirl, I was immediately turned off by her lack of originality. I had been wearing black and white striped armwarmers, TWO of them, at skoo weeks before she caught on at my high skoo, before I even knew about her. And yet, I got condemned because I refused to wear one &amp;quot;like Avril&amp;quot;. So tell me, what's the message Avril's sending across again? Originality? I think not.   Another reason I've become fairly opposed to Avril fans, is the fact that they take the time to flame those of us expressing our own unique opinions about Avril, thinking it's going to stop us from doing it. And this may be being preached at 390428042380423094 other anti-Avril sites, but so be it. WE. DON'T. CARE. In fact, when somebody flames me, not only do I laugh at the grammatical errors, I get others to laugh by being anything BUT angry. If you expect me to get mad because I'm &amp;quot;not as pretty as her&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;u zuxxor, u btich!&amp;quot;, I'm not. I laugh, then respond. If you're flaming me to get your own section up in the hate part of this site, you've won the grand spankin' prize. But not only that, you're the laughing stock of the internet community who hates Avril, like me. Congratu-friggin-lations, man. You got what you signed up for. Really, when I get flamed, I feel obligated to add more to the site. In fact, one site inspired me to draw a parody cartoon to add to this site. Inspiration comes from you, the haters. No matter how much you may hate me, I will love you for giving me more inspiration. It seems you're a walking contradiction, for when you flame, you seem to be trying to get me to think your way, but really, it only reminds me more and more of why I hate Avril and her fans so much. Thank you, thank you very much.   And I suppose those are the major reasons I tend to dislike Avril fans. Sure, this is pretty stereotyped. I'm very sure that not ALL Avril fans fit this criteria. But until I find an intelligent, well-supported Avril fan, I still laugh at you all.    Who I Want to Meet:   People often tell me I'm jealous. All I have to say to that is &amp;quot;Are you jealous of everyone you hate?&amp;quot; Of course not. So why would I be jealous of Avril? She's not cute, she has no talent, she's a hypocrite, she's annoying, she's a bitch, and she should be deported.     ok, so after reading all of this crap from a so called 'REAL rakistas', i wrote her a message... hehehe... and it actually made me feel better about myself for a while... the message:    hey... i'm not with you, nor against you.. i just thought i'd point out a couple things that i thought you should know:  1.) if you hate her like you say you do, then why are you giving her so much friggin attention?!? don't think so? well, you went through the whole process of making a why-i-hate-avril essay, and, of course, your famous 'parody cartoon'.. like it or not, that's still devoting your time to her.. if you hate her like you say you do, then you'd just let her go unnoticed... let her be, and in time, she'll die out on her own...  2.) i noticed how you kept bringing up the fact that most of her fans weren't too good at english.. well, by bringing that up as many times as you did, that puts our expectations up higher for YOUR english... oh, by the way, i did notice errors in your english AND the english of the so-called avril haters... i would think you wouldn't accept the testimonials written by those with low grammatical skills.. ha! boy, did i think wrong.. oh, just so you know, if i just so happen to have grammatical errors in this message, (1) this isn't going public anyway, and (2) i dare you to point them out for me...  3.) you say that avril is sterotypical... well how about you and the rest of the avril-hating world? the way you judge the avril fans is no different than the way she judges preps.. ever think of it that why? i doubt it.. how egotistic is someone who puts up a friendster account devoted to hating someone else? how about the rest of this 'hating society' that supports this egotist? how big are their egos?  4.) let's see... you have 91 friends in this account, which means that you've found at least 91 people who share in your opinion.. you've reached out and affected around 91 people... how many do you think avril lavigne has affected? chances are, more than you could ever imagine.. like it or not, she has fans, and there's not much you can do about it...  5.) you say that you're inspired by all those avril fans out there who send you hatemail, right? don't you ever wonder that maybe you're inspiring them too? if you answered 'no' to that last question, THINK AGAIN.. you're just fuelling their rage against people like you, and inspiring them to become even bigger fans of avril lavigne...  6.) correct me if i'm wrong, but you are, deep at heart, an avril lavigne fan... you would have been like one of those who praise avril, except maybe, along the way, you were afraid it would put a bad mark on your reputation as a so-called (and i quote) 'REAL Rakistas'... think again... a real rocker (as i would say it) would learn to keep her mouth shut..    well, she hasn't replied... which is pretty funny... hehe... maybe i'll go diss a couple more...</td>

I'm so relieved that it went so well!  She's had a lot to tell me about this morning, too.  They saw so many things.  R fed the giraffes right out of her hand!  She had a wolf behind a glass enclosure that was nose to nose with her and pounced at her several times, like it was trying to get a mouse!  The monkeys woke them early, howling to be fed!  It was a great experience for her.  And she had a great time!  J called around 11:15 a.m. to say he was at the top of the hill on the ride!  This is the quickest he's ever gotten to the top.  He gets to ride down, at least 90% of the way, back now.  He was pretty excited!  His riding buddy, however, only made it about 40 miles and turned back.  Anyway, this means he'll be home earlier than he would have.  That will be nice....and means I need to come up with something for dinner.  lol.  Last night, I'd wanted to post some other stuff and sort of ran out of time.  I seem to have a better chance posting everything if I do it during the day.  So, that's why I'm posting early today.    I watched President Reagan's funeral Thurs. on TV.  Of course, when someone dies, people tend to be more kind to them, but I thought it was amazing how many people showed their respects to him.  Just normal people - not just the usual dignitaries.  And I always thought him a good man and a good president.  As in every case, no one is flawless and he made his mistakes like the rest of us do.  But all in all, he did some amazing things as president.  I think his wife felt good knowing so many people thought well of him, too.  It was a huge kindness to her, as well.  Then, watching all the former presidents and our current president sitting together, I realized all but the Clintons had really good, long lasting marriages, too, like the Reagans.  I thought that a powerful statement in a country where divorce rates are so high.  And so no one reads that statement wrong.....I believe there are marriages that are not salvagable, but I think those are a pretty low percentage.  These are the marriages where some terrible wrong has been done to a spouse, where abuse exists, where there is no love ever or for a long time, where there is no respect or decency toward one or both partners, where one partner is not willing to work at making things better or commits such horrible acts that forgiveness is extremely difficult, if not impossible.  The marriages that bring the percentage up so high, I think, are when people just stop working at being married, being a couple, they live as though they are on their own, not a spouse to someone, they quit when things get a little tough.  I clarify this because I know many people who are no longer married, are on their way out of a bad marriage or are on an additional marriage.  And they are good people who had these circumstances that couldn't be resolved.  I want them to know that I don't pass judgement on them or condemn them for their decisions.  Who the heck would I be to do such a thing as that?  It was just can observation that came from watching the funeral.  We got a security system put in today.  If you know me, you know we have little money.  But this is a new Honeywell system that they are trying to get out, so with a 3 year contract, we got all the equipment free (over $1000.00 worth) and then we'll have a monthly fee of $40. for the system.  With my working now, we can afford that and since J works nights, it will be an added safety for R and I.  We have 3 days to decide if we want to keep it, too.  So, we'll see how it goes.  R's best friend called and invited her to go play on a Slip'N'Slide in her backyard today.  I drove her over this afternoon and she stayed til 5 p.m.  Had I finished this post shortly after I started it, instead of crashing on the bed for an hour today after I took R over to her friend's - lol - I'd have been done with this post already!  I haven't done a gratitude journal in some time, so I'll wrap up with that.  1.  I am grateful for my husband and daughter - for all the things they teach me, for the way they make me a better person, for the love they give me and allow me to return to them, for the family that we are, for the way they took my loneliness away when they came into my life - each filling my heart in a different way.  2.  I am grateful for other members of my church.  The two young men that came to the house today to first, sell us the security system and second, install it, are both members of our church.  The company they work for, which actually markets the new product for Honeywell, is based in Orem, Utah.  I had been uncomfortable at first because J was gone, R was gone and I was talking to the first one and let him in the house when we decided to try the system.  Then he saw our pictures on the wall - of the prophet of our church and his two counselors, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, of Christ....and he said, 'I bet you guys go to this church right over here,' pointing to our church, which is right next to our townhouse complex.  I said, 'Yes.  How did you know that?' not thinking about the pictures on the wall, which we are used to.  He pointed them out, then told me he was LDS and what ward he attends while here (they only work in an area for about 3-4 months, then return home for a few months before they go to the next job area).  I felt calm and relieved then.  That's not to say that all LDS people are good and trustworthy, but there is definately a connection bewteen us when they are good people.  The same thing happened with the young man that came in to install the system about an hour later.  3.  I am grateful for the cooler days we are having - under 90 these last few days.  4.  I am grateful for our dog and how safe she makes me feel when I'm home alone or J is gone at night, working.  She's a good protecter and well behaved for the most part.  5.  I am grateful for having the things I believe to be important in my life - family, good friends, love, my sight, hearing, other senses, being an American, my faith, my freedom and being happy overall.  If things were to change in an instant today or tomorrow, I would have in my life the things that are most important to me.</td>

I got a chance to meditate this morning which has hopefully helped my outlook for the day. Let's see how long I can keep the positive outlook.

      <td>Thankfully, the more destructive storm elements (hail, lightning, tornadoes, etc.) seem to have stopped in the area, leaving only the fun of flooding.  Apparently a record was broken today - 4.4 inches of rain so far, and more on the way no doubt.  Now, you see, this part of Texas at least has a rather high water table.  That means that if it even rains half an inch, expect parking lots to become rivers.  This even moreso.  So, roads are closed.  Rivers are flooded.  And I half expect my second-storey apartment to begin sailing its way to the Gulf of Mexico at any moment.  Might be nice...haven't really been to the Gulf yet....but I wager all the people from the lower floors would want to join in.  Could be a party.  Or could be  urlLink the raft of the Medusa .

Highlighting such acts (let me stress ACTS) as R.E.M. with their flaming front man Michael Stipes (uh oh, I was just labeled homophobic), John Mellencamp (who cares anymore, he's been forgotten), Pearl Jam (Oh now there's a bunch of role models for our children!), Jackson Browne (Free Pot for everybody), and of course the Dixie Chicks (Communist broads who wouldn't know Dixie if it bit them in the ASS).

And John Fogerty, well he's older than mud but I still liked his music.  I guess my point is why do these celebrities feel that it is necessary to  to flex their so-called superstardom to attract votes for the liberal weanies.  I am sorry but they need to mind their own business, they are actors, singers, and comedians. NOT POLITICIANS.  And i am sure that some poor helpless idiot out there who cannot make a decision for themselves who will see these buffoons and claim, Oh I am gonna vote for the Pearl Jam canidate.  Not only that but what qualifies these celebrities to pursue political aspirations.  Give me a frigin' break people.  I work in enforcement, therefore I enforce.  I don't get our here and play a concert for President Bush claiming that we need HOPE and we need CHANGE.  It's a crock of crap, especially when you are supporting a canidate like Kerry who can't flip fast enough to catch his flops.

      <td>Today, I turn 27.  I cried last night, and the night before that, and the night before that, at the thought of turning 27.  Not because I’m suddenly 'old' or that much closer to 30, but because I look around me and see all the blessings that I have and I know that 27 is going to be a great year.  When I turned 25, I saw myself as a successful career woman who wanted to continue my education and not miss out on a single party invitation that came my way.  I looked at my friends and thanked God that I didn’t have a child to tie me down or a mortgage or bills, DEAR GOD, THE BILLS.  Then I ended up getting  urlLink married, drunk and pregnant , all in one night ... and my life was forever changed.  25 would never look the same again.  And I was only 3 months into it!  I had to say good-bye to that previous life.  I had to say good-bye to continuing my education and the parties.  And hello to big panties (who am I kidding, I still wore a thong every day I was pregnant) and swollen ankles.  I had to save money and eat healthy and STOP DRINKING.  No more long evenings at Friday’s with Mary or late nights partying in Deep Ellum.  I mourned for months, because, in essence, I had to come to grips with the death of my youth.  Then came 26.   26 was an even more difficult year.  Harder than I thought survivable.  I remember my 26th birthday vividly – 7 days overdue and praying incessantly that my pregnancy was all a joke that someone forgot to let me in on.  I was at my parent’s house, blowing out candles with my fake, sorority girl smile.  After all, I was glowing (sweating) and had a baby on the way.  A BABY!  A BABY WOULD BE HERE VERY SOON!  PROOF THAT THE WORLD SHOULD GO ON!  And I’d never been more scared, angry, confused and depressed in all my life.  Having a child while fighting for a marriage is not at all how I envisioned my life would be.  I never knew how demanding being a wife AND a mother would be.  So, I spent a good part of my 26th year bitter.  Bitter at my husband, bitter at my child and bitter at God.  But then something clicked, almost over night.  I suddenly realized that, hey, I have a  urlLink BEAUTIFUL little girl , a  urlLink marriage worth fighting for  and a God who’s on my side, even if I sometimes think He’s full of crap.  I know 27 is not going to be a bed of roses.  But I’ve learned much more over the past year than many learn in a lifetime.  And, secretly, I’m sorta glad for all the pain.  Because, without it, I would’ve missed out on so many of life’s lessons.  So now I’m crying again ... and I’ve never been happier.</td>

(huge sigh of relief)  however, this is not all good news, as now it seems that i probably have to go back to normal schooling... starting 8:10 thursday morning... how am i ever going to get back into the routine of full days at school?!?   oh well, at least i have the long weekend to look forward to!  thats right... queen's birthday weekend... such an australian concept.   'hey, i feel like a holiday...'  'i have an idea! lets make up an extended weekend in commemoration of the birth of some old bird we couldn't really care less about!'   yes, the queen... noone in australia really recognizes the british monarch as having anything to do with our country, because, lets be frank... she doesn't.  but that is no reason why we shouldn't get a free day off work... to not take a holiday would be unaustralian...  i love my country...  onto my next story...   (note: that was called a 'linking sentence'... my english teacher says i should use these so my essays flow more fluently... but back to the story...)  well, it seems like this blog has sprouted a lot of small projects for me...  the first is the background... and yes... i haven't forgotten, i just haven't managed to get around to it between my playing pool and watching anime...  this project means i will need to learn how to use photoshop pretty well, which didn't seem too hard at first... but that program has sooooo many buttons!  The second began as a sort of offshoot of this... while consulting one of my many geeky (yet fairly cool please don't attack me with parcel bombs) friends on how this site worked.   Well, somehow he decided to start abusing me for the fact that my site was not pure xhtml, and that i should fix it...   so i have taken his advice, and decided to at least gain a knowledge of programming (or writing html, because technically html is not a code for making programs, but only for marking up static pages - see i'm learnig already!), to the extent that i can at least understand 3% of all the bullshit he was feeding me...   seriously, who really cares if some geek on a freeware operating system can't see my page in the way it is intended? not me!! hahaha... stupid cheap geeks..  anyway... i am deciding to gain a simple knowledge of writing html, just for the fact that i can say that i can... it might make me sound smart :)  and lets face it... chicks dig smart blokes... hehehe...  toodaloo! see you next time!</td>

      <td>Auspicious begining for my third post, no? Well, something wicked this way comes, the most sinister day of the year...my birthday. Yesterday I was a little down (and fairly annoyed as well) I always seem to get pre-birthday blues a day or 2 before the big day. Now don't get me wrong, I'll only be 24, so it's not like I'm feeling my age or anything like that, but I dunno, it just kinda, sorta happens. As for this evening, I'm not sure what exactly is going to happen, I know that I'm going to have fun! Hanging with friends, and spending as much time inebriated as possible. I look forward to it. I think I shall head to this arcade....but I don't know. I kinda would like to spend time with a friend of mine, but....a.) I don't want to get him sick of me and b.)I don't want the 'condition' that I'll be in to affect things with him. Cause he's a good guy, and I really like spending time with him, but I don't want him to get hurt. I always seem to hurt the nice ones. Not purposely... of course not. He should probably run screaming in the opposite direction now. Reguardless of that fact, I don't think he will. But if he doesn't, I dunno. I guess we'll see. At the moment, good friends is all I need to be with anyone, life's safer that way. :) That way, no one gets hurt, and everybody's happy. There are times when I wonder if it wouldn't be safer for everyone to just have a stable full of cuddle bitches and let it go at that. (cuddle bitches- guys whose sole purpose is for cuddling and fuzziness-feelings without intimacy, emotions, or sex. So basically like a teddy bear that hugs back that you can put back on the shelf when finished.) At the same time, keeping up with them can sometimes be annoying as well. So, I guess I'll just have to let things progress and see where this life thing leads. Having said that, it's about time I end this post and dip. Byeeee!</td>

Apparently, looking 4 me.. Seems that they had some news to confine in me.&amp;nbsp; Bad news though.. But i wont go through it. So at around 2.30pm. Took a bus to the CID building in Outram park. Had a very gross time here. Very disturbing pictures.. Haiz.. Couldn't have lunch.. Haha. So at 5pm, the sec3 left the buliding and headed back to school. No time to go home to change into home clothes. Crap! Anyway, rushed back to school, barely had time to eat something then took a bus to BPGHS. We all got settled n then the campfire staretd.. Fantastic pryo works. So the night proceeds with alot of fun.. Singing, jumping lots of fun.. Hahah outta breath. Anyway, it was a memorable night 4 reason i won't disclose but that someone will know wat i'm toking abt.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, after sending my GF home, i had to rush to get a train home.

      <td>Speaking of secular music...  I'm a big fan of Christian music. At least, the good Christian music. Anything that has a positive outlook on life is most likely going to be better for you than say, Slipknot. (Who suck, by the way.)  But also for the record, I listened to Siamese Dream by The Smashing Pumpkins today, and can I just say, dag! I forgot how much they rocked. It's always interesting to observe the type of music that you gravitate towards depending what type of mood youre in or what type of week youre having. For example: Jon is in a pissy mood, Jon listens to Smashing Pumpkins. And Jon feels somehow better. It's cathartic somehow, in an odd way.

      <td>Today... less good. To tell the truth, I've had better days. Not that it was particularly bad, just I got inwardly annoyed quite a few times today.  We'll start from the very beginning (it's a very good place to start). Again, for the 4th time this term, neither mine nor Mum's alarms went off, forcing me to take the 94 into Gloucester. Upside, though, is that I got in at 0820 today, whereas last time I got in at 0905. But still, yeah. Then I had a long private study period. Not too bad. Physics mock. Which was pretty fucking solid.  Spent the entire time during lunch whizzing around, trying to locate either Sally or Rachel to discover possible rehearsal times. I also needed to tell Rachel that she'd probably be doing Last Night of The World with Scott. Couldn't find either of them, it was like trying to find 6th formers in a Primary School, although this was a Secondary School. And I still couldn't find them. General feeling was 'bugger'. Then, get lumbered with the fact that Pete's already put me in charge of organising the music for this light entertainment thing, and spent a ridiculously large amount of time thinking about themes, and songs people could do. My brain is wiped for ideas. Sam Taunton seems to want to fuck up my whole schedule, I'm damned if I'm going to let him take over the performances. I know he's come back from almost dying but that doesn't mean he should get all the songs. Alright, that's a little harsh, but it's taken a lot of brain power, and it's going to take a lot of the time I don't have, organising this. I don't have time for people to mess it up before I've even started. &gt;_  THEN, after school, choir. Usually, first rehearsal back is a jolly occasion where we do sod all. Not today. We sang through the entire first number of Carmina Burana (O Fortuna), which goes up to a Bb and is the only written tenor part in an SATB lineup that I've ever seen go up there. Later, discovered that the tenor part goes up to a C! Fuck...  Get home. Alex and the kids are laughing all the time, which cuts through me like a knife. Gwen's in a piss for no reason. Bugger it, go and play the piano and get told to shut up by Jericho, who's watching the telly. I promptly respond 'no' and continue practicing Last Night Of the World, which I discover to have 6 sharps. Once again, fuck, but for the reason that I CAN'T go wrong under a duet of Rachel and Scott. That'd be travesty. So I sit there, hammering away, being told that's 'enough' from Alex, who's a little wanker when he wants to be. Supper. Not too bad, no reason to be pissed off at supper. Dad's constant nattering on the phone stopped me from doing my paper round. And I know that now this is all yesterday, but fuck that.  Was promptly reminded (reminded being the key word, given that I knew nothing about this until I was 'reminded') that I was to put the skittles up at the St. Mary's Social thing. So, I thought, should be a laugh. Ollie and I usually natter a bit. WRONG. Ollie wasn't there, I spent my entire time feeling on my own, and (I'm not saying this is either of their faults, they're wonderful people and they didn't mind when I interjected, BUT) feeling cut out from Rhiannon and Dan conversing. Every time Dan went somewhere else, I wanted to talk to Rhiannon, I love talking to Rhiannon. But nothing came to say, and she looked at me uncomfortably, while I felt ill, wanted to retreat. I liked seeing her happy though, while she was talking to Dan. I liked seeing Dan happy while he was gloating about how strange his life as a student was. I didn't mind being cut out, so much. I did when I was interjecting and it was completely irrelevant, and I minded the look Rhiannon gave me. It was as if I was some kind of sub-human idiot. Which, it must be said, may be true, but I don't want to be reminded of the fact. And she didn't mean to do it, I'm sure she didn't, but she wanted to catch up with an old friend, which I can appreciate. In comparison to Dan (and most people, coming to think of it) I'm a little more than just a bit boring. But... I don't know, I like talking to Rhiannon, this seems more of a rant than it should.  In comparison, Mr. T's put me in for my Grade 8, taking the pressure of choice off my shoulders, I've sorted out almost all the pieces for the light entertainment, I've completed a week of my mocks already, Zoe's invited me to her B-day party, Laura's sent me an email, and I saw Rhiannon. I'm still annoyed, and very tired. But... yeah, I do have a right to be, I can be annoyed if I want. I wish I wasn't, it's all so insignificant. Heh, Dan said that I'd come home and blog about everything. Well, Dan, I did ^^.  Quote of the Day: 'At the end of the day, you're another day colder, And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill.

Now, we get back to real life where other people exist.    We did the whole thing at San Antonio.  We went to the Alamo, Riverwalk, Fiesta Texas, Guenther House (Pioneer Flour Mill),Downtown, side trip to San Marcos, and read a book.  We ate a lot, slept a lot, and went real slow!    I feel very rested and ready to complete the summer.  Thankfully, I have some wonderful people here at home who can make it possible for me to leave and things not go undone.  Some of those people are:  Donna, Blake, David, Dan, Kenneth, Leah H., Bill, Toni, Dan M., Doug, Gary, Chris, Denise, Debbie, Pat, Laura, and many others.  Every minister must be a team player.  Every minister must be a part of the team, not merely it's leader.  I have a wonderful advisory team that is official (Youth Ministry Team).  However, I also have many wonderful parents and friends who are willing to step in and help out!    If you can leave and things run as if you never left, then you have a sign of a healthy ministry.

At the end of the party, he invited her to have coffeewith him, she was surprised, but due to being polite,she promised.   They sat in a nice coffee shop, he was too nervous to say anything,she felt uncomfortable, she thought,'please, let me go home..'  Suddenly he asked the waiter: 'would you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee.' Everybody stared at him, so strange! His face turned red, but,still, he put the salt in his coffee and drank it. She asked him curiously: why you have this hobby?  He replied: 'when I was a little boy, I was living near the sea, I liked playing in the sea, I could feel the taste of the sea, just like the taste of the salty coffee. Now every time I have the salty coffee, I always think of my childhood, think of my hometown, I miss my hometown so much, I miss my parents who are still living there'.  While saying that tears filled his eyes. She was deeply touched.  That's his true feeling, from the bottom of his heart. A man who can tell out his homesickness, he must be a man who loves home, cares about home, has responsibility of home..  Then she also started to speak, spoke about her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family. That was a really nice talk, also a beautiful beginning of their story. They continued to date. She found that actually he was a man who meets all her demands; he had tolerance, was kind hearted, warm, careful. He was such a good person but she almost missed him! Thanks to his salty coffee! Then the story was just like every beautiful love story, the princess married to the prince, then they were living the happy life... And, every time she made coffee for him, she put some salt in the coffee, as she knew that's the way he liked it.  After 40 years, he passed away, left her a letter which said:  'My dearest, please forgive me, forgive my whole life lie. This was the only lie I said to you--- the salty coffee.Remember the first time we dated? I was so nervous at that time, actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt It was hard for me to change so I just went ahead. I never thought that could be the start of our communication! I tried to tell you the truth  many times in my life, but I was too afraid to do that, as I have promised not to lie to you for anything..  Now I'm dying, I afraid of nothing so I tell you the truth: I don't like the salty coffee, what a strange bad taste.. But I have had the salty coffee for my whole life! Since I knew you, I never feel sorry for anything I do for you. Having you with me is my biggest happiness for my whole life. If I can live for the second time, still want to know you and have you for my whole life, even though I have to drink the salty coffee again'.  Her tears made the letter totally wet.   Someday, someone asked her: what's the taste of salty coffee?  It's sweet. She replied.   Love is not to forget  but to forgive not to see but understand  not to hear  but to listen not to let go but HOLD ON !!!!

      <td>urlLink   The nice thing about going to a ball where everyone else is 50+ is that you get to hear a lot about how pretty you are.  I actually got asked if I found my beauty to be a burden.  Heh.  Not actually a problem I've been struggling with, burdensome beauty, but thank you for asking.  My Aunt Mimi gave me a lot of romantic advice, which was comforting, especially since her marriage lasted for a blissful 60 years.  It's nice to be reassured that extreme pickiness doesn't necessarily lead to years of spinsterhood with no one but stray cats for company.  There were a lot of elderly people doing old-fashioned Russian dances, which reminded me of the scene in  The Sound of Music  where Maria and Captain Von Trapp do the Austrian folk dance.  Megan and I busted out the DVD and watched when I got home.  Our conclusion: Christopher Plummer is S-E-X-X-Y sexy!  He's always yelling and insisting that his children do ridiculous things like march about the grounds, breathing deeply, but then his icy exterior is totally melted by the sassy, young-at-heart governess who blushes furiously when he looks at her.  Any movie where the heroine is considered alluring because she has a tendency to turn eight shades of pink gets, like, 50 bonus points on the Anna Rating Scale.   Megan and I did, however, feel a lot of sympathy for Baroness Schraeder, the icy blond who the Captain jilts when he falls for Maria.  She's, like, 18 times more poised and sophisticated than Maria, and she gets tossed aside for this young, simple thing.  That's gotta feel unfair.  She's a lot like Summer from The O.C., whom we LOVE.  You know who else used to be sexy?   urlLink Howard Dean!   (Check out the pictures Ginny forwarded Megan.)  Give that man the Warren G. Harding Memorial Award for Dreamiest Candidate EVA.  The Anna Primary just got a little closer.  Props to Ginny, by the way, for tackling the vital 'Which candidate is sexiest?' issue, which the mainstream media is apparently too scared to touch.

      <td>October 10, 2002  The cool weather has come, and rain.  All that is left of the garden are three struggling pepper plants and about a half bushel of tomatoes that will never ripen.  On a quick noon walk, I noticed one tomato plant had actually exploded with blossoms again in a frantic but futile protest of the coming frost. The rain is welcome, but awfully slow – barely more than a drizzle.  Supper is now past, and the rain hasn’t amounted to more than a half inch since breakfast.  The wet and the chill would be a good excuse for a foul mood, but I am relaxed and reasonably cheerful. Driving today was tedious, with the constant need to readjust the speed of the windshield wipers.  Yesterday, though, driving was pleasant even with an overcast sky.  Trees are trying to turn, harvested fields reveal new views and pumpkins are popping up on plenty of porches. On the way into town yesterday, I was forced by detour to take the road that runs through the college campus.  It was mid-afternoon and the campus was quiet.  Parked cars were evidence that school was in session, but I saw no students until I crested the hill and happened to spot a pretty coed with an armload of books.  I glanced her way and our eyes met, briefly.  Her reaction was resentment, and I immediately felt guilty for my glance.  I drove on. Yet, as I drove, I reconsidered.  I realize I know next to nothing about this young woman and nothing at all about how other men may have treated her.  But I only glanced – I meant no harm and no insult.  If anything, I intended a compliment.  I did not leer.  I did not lust.  I did not stop and stare.  I merely admired momentarily, without a desire to conquer or possess.  Her face and form were a welcome relief from all that was gray and gloomy. No one ever glances at me, at least not for the reason I glanced at the young woman with an armload of books.  I have been spared all firsthand knowledge of what it is like to be beautiful.  I suppose it can often be a burden.  And I realize that in certain circles, even a brief glance may be considered an insult.  Even so, I think I can be absolved, for morals always trump manners and I am convinced that we sin when we do not pay attention to beauty, wherever we find it.</td>

      <td>PBS didn't run ' urlLink The Legendary Liberace ' for any high-minded purpose. They threw it in during pledge week a few months ago to squeeze the 55-and-older demographic for cash. Still, it was a hoot.  As a pianist and entertainer, Liberace was pure old-school vaudeville, a hardworking entertainer who did whatever it took to knock 'em dead. From the 1940s to the 1980s he entertained audiences with an act that was more cocktail party than concert. The patter and the occasional songs were just an excuse to show off costumes that leave one  urlLink speechless . Calling his costumes gaudy is just inadequate; it's like calling the ocean wet.  Liberace may be an entertainment footnote today, but in the 1950s the man was  huge . He was the first Vegas superstar -- he opened there in the late '40s when the town had exactly two hotels, and his style is still imprinted in the town's DNA. When the fledgling television networks blew him off, he syndicated himself and ran on more TV stations than 'I Love Lucy.'  Time hasn't been kind to Liberace's shtick. The jokes fall flat and the music is Welkian dreck. Yet the costumes and staging are so over the top, so beyond any fashion or style, that they never age.  Even more fascinating is Liberace's rapport with his fans. Judging from the video clips, his TV and stage shows attracted a mostly female audience of a certain age, all of whom looked like  urlLink Auntie Em  or  urlLink Dame Edna . It's no mystery why those stolid '50s middle-American matrons went gaga over a borderline drag queen. After all, their stolid '50s middle-American husbands ate red meat at every meal, raised sexual harassment to an art form, and saw a Commie pinko under every rock. Who wouldn't want an alternative?  The  urlLink Liberace Foundation  claims to be the Official Liberace Web site. The  urlLink Estate of Liberace  does too. The  urlLink Liberace Museum  is the Official Animated Twinkling Candelabra site.

      <td>I am a ghetto superstar.  Trapped in a life of late bills and bouncing car payments, there's no denying I am  soooo  ghetto. I long ago learned how to evade the bill collector. 'Katherine? Oh, she's out to the grocery.' The formal name is always a dead giveaway and an instant connection to my voicemail.  My cellphone is three years old and one of the hinges is held together with superglue.   My car begs for new brakes every time I hit the pedal. I also need a new exhaust pipe and some major work on the grill.   A minor accident 10 months ago smashed up the front end... and now the little German sports car looks like something destined for the junk yard. (Pipe in the theme song from Sanford and Son  here .) I don't own a vacuum because I don't want to spend the fifty bucks, and don't have an iron and ironing board because I can't fit it in my budget. My car radio doesn't work because I don't want to take the car in to be serviced.  But life isn't all ramen noodles and canned tuna. This is the part where I confess my sins of selective budgeting. It's way easier for me to squeeze in with a shoe horn a dinner out with friends than it is a trip to to the 10 minute oil change.  Now, I know what you're going to say... so let me head you off by saying I'm not living beyond my means. I just choose to slave away in an industry that fails to compensate people appropriately for their time and sacrifice. My college degree and over five years of experience is unfortunately not enough to garner a reasonable wage.  So until I DO find that cush career, you know... the one with the perks, the office, and enough money for me to pay my bills on time with a little bit extra for the savings account? Well, until that time comes I'll be slaving away at the 38th Parallel... just waiting for my big break.      Whoever said television was glamorous must have been on crack.</td>

All these stories and experiences led us to make a pact...in 2006 (wishful thinking but is a goal we'll work hard to achieve), the three of us will go on a cruise around Asia with side trips to Singapore and HK for shopping of course!!! :)  Its really fun to talk about things like this, I really hope it pushes through!

      <td>Wow!  I stopped checking this blog because no one was blogging much.  Then I check in today, and there's lots and lots!  Can I just tell you how fun that is?  It's like being away from your computer or Internet access for a long time and not being able to check your email, and then...when you finally do....there's a gajillion emails!  Okay, maybe not, because they aren't addressed to me.  Or, an even better illustration is when you don't watch TV for a really long time (my life is way too busy for TV, I can go for months without it, except in Alias season), and then you turn it on to find out that there's a marathon of your favorite show (like Alias; it rocks!) and there's a whole bunch of new episodes and you get to watch them all at once instead of waiting a new week for the new one.  Anyway, my point is that it's very exciting.  So I haven't read all of the things that were posted during my absence from the 'random' blog, but the ones that I have read have been extremely entertaining.  Like this one by Jamie, for example: 'What would I do with 115,000,000?? I would give it to George W. Bush to get him elected to a second term, just so Jon would get really irritated.' That's so great, Jamie D.  I think that's a great way to spend the cash.  Man, I really need to get you and Jon and Jeff to have one of your discussions when my friend Bec is around.

      <td>A few times recently - 3 times in the last 2 days?! - I've written something in a blog or by email that's either been taken with the wrong intent or has turned into something much bigger than how it started.  I know this process isn't unique to me, but it's still making me uncomfortable.  I'm going to try (as always) to fix it by explaining, even as I can hear the echo of my conscience whispering, 'Let it go.'  That's not in my make-up.  This whole mess (or at least what I think of as being a mess) started with my job.  Until January, I was the part-time (28-32 hours/week) Head of Technical Services, supervising two staff members who worked 20 and 30 hours weekly.  One left in January for what I can only assume are personal reasons.  I found out that she was leaving by email while I was on vacation, through a confusing web of communications with several people.  The last week that she was going to work (after I'd returned), she didn't come in four of the five days that she'd been scheduled due to bad weather and/or illness, and on the one day that she did work, she left several hours early.  The result of all that was that I began the year feeling like I couldn't catch up and had very little idea what she actually did.  She had made it clear, though, before she left, that she never had 30 actual hours of work to do, so the new hire shouldn't be expected to work that much.  Since we'd never adjusted her position after the library automated, that was a reasonable assessment.  So I decided, with the support of the library director, to wait for a couple of weeks before posting the position, to determine more closely what our actual needs were for that area.  I split the work with the other staff member, and received additional help from some members of the circulation department as they could afford to give it.  After a few weeks and lots of consideration, I met with the director and determined a pay-rate and number of hours, based on the expectations that could be met by a theoretical candidate for the job.  Frankly, there are a number of ways that the job could be filled, and if someone were hired who could do the minimum but very well, they would be paid accordingly and no more.  That's not unreasonable.  But if we found the perfect combination of experience, creativity and motivation, then the pay-rate and number of hours would increase quite a bit.    The job was suggested to someone who I'd had in mind all along, but that person was not interested at that time.  We posted the job internally.  Two people applied, were interviewed, and were not right for the position.  After a great deal of consideration, I chose to take on the additional duties myself rather than posting the job externally.  I'll begin working full-time on March 22.  Until then I'm scrambling to do the primary job I was hired to do (cataloging), plus the job I've since taken on that is really my first love (selection and acquisitions), plus all the myriad extra duties that have been piled on in the intervening years.  Plus  all  of the processing, since the other cataloger has basically decided that if she doesn't get a raise, she's not going to do it.  I'll not get into that now; our relationship is a constant challenge that will never be resolved.    However, the person that I originally wanted in Processing - who would be perfect for it and for all of the other collateral responsibilities that were optional - is free now to take a position if one becomes available.  So I just wish that I could go back in time and give the job to her, and keep my own regular 28-32 (well, it's closer to 32, really), and not have to change my life so much.    But there's no going back, right?  So I'm periodically freaking out, trying desperately to get through my piles of paperwork, boxes of books, mountains of donations, inboxes teeming with email screaming for replies, and always in the back of my mind, the thought,  'This Is The Rest Of Your Life.'   I didn't sign on for this, you know?  I wasn't going to do this or be this.  I always said that if I wanted to die of a heart attack by age 35, I'd have been an attorney - at least the money would be better.  And who do I have to blame for being here and doing this?  No one but me.  So boo fucking hoo, really.  I knew it would happen.  That's why, when  urlLink Jenica  pensively asked this week - probably rhetorically - 'How many hours per week is too many hours per week to be working? And what is 'enough'? How about 'satisfied', 'accomplished', 'done', or 'productive'?', I opened her Comments box immediately and chimed in.  Well, I was limited to 1000 characters and on my first try I think I probably exceeded that by 3 times.  Who better to give advice than someone who's desperately in need of it?  So I spouted off exactly what  I  need to hear, or  not,  and when I read her blog the next day, I was stunned - literally - to see how negatively my comments had been taken.  'All I'd said was...' that she should work a little extra now so that she feels more caught up, and then she should go back to her normal routine.  'Cause that's pretty much what I'm going to have to do, soon.  But judging by the comments that other people left, I'm not only a fool, I'm also proposing that she ruin her life in pursuit of an unattainable goal: work satisfaction.  So I (much as I'm doing now) hopped back into the fray to say, 'Well, I was just looking at it from my own point of view, which happens to also be, very basically, the same sort of atmosphere in which she (Jenica) works.'  Not sure that went over any better.  It probably came off sounding all holier than thou (which it does now) because 'none of you can understand - you're not living La Vida Librarian!'  Ah, I'm such an idiot.  Naturally, I was led to think about why I'd given in to those urges to use someone else's blog as my forum for (attempted) disputing my internal demons.  And it came to me that it has something to do with my concept of 'self' and 'personhood' and feeling and being 'different'.  And, naturally, when I'm in for a penny, I'm in for a pound, what better way to get that out than to blog it?  Last night, I tried to explain it, and did so badly, through my understanding of my own -ism or lack of same.  Yeah, that's what I meant -  my own  lack of feminism.  The part of me that feels weird or deficient when I'm in conversation with other strong women because they go about things so differently than the way that I do, or they seem to understand things so much differently than I do.  It's like I'm missing some key element that makes it all makes sense.  I'd so much rather play pool than make a scrapbook, you know?  But that doesn't meant that I'm claiming any particular lack of femin inity  - 'cause I'd love to have nice fingernails and there are few pleasures on earth like having one's hair washed (I mean, really, if most men knew what it's really like to have a shampoo and condition in a nice salon, it would be against the law).  My lingerie drawer is so full that it's actually two drawers, and I used to buy lots of 'product' (a la Kyan) until Lori taught me the error of my ways (I can spend more on what I want, rather than getting tons of different things and not using half of them).  But I don't know Harriet Tubman from Clara Barton, and I don't know suffrage from a hole in the ground.  Perhaps I 'should' - fuck, I  know  I 'should' - but if I can't be troubled to remember how many miles it is from the library to NILS for travel expense reports (I always have to look it up), there's no room in my head for stuff I 'should' know.    And it seemed, and seems, important to explain this to the people who might be reading the things that I write and wondering where my head is when I'm writing.  Particularly because I seem to have an all-female audience, at least as far as those who undertake to comment are concerned.  (I know that you're reading, Californian, even if you don't say anything.)  Anyway, if I'm writing like a jackass, I wanted you to know that it's because this is  me , this is how I think, and it's  not  because I think this is how anyone else should think.  Ugh; I'm starting to get philosophically muddy and should probably just stop before I make it any worse.  I'll just say one more thing.  My intention wasn't to set the cause of feminism (or any other -ism) back 20 years.  It was only to clarify my own perspective of firmly-held confusion.  Ach.  This is all too serious.  Next post will be my typical oddity - I promise.</td>

We were about as packed as we could get though; in addition to reserved parties we had two walk-in parties.  It was the busiest I've ever seen it.  Tonight I saw M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Village.'  Immediately after the movie was over, I didn't quite understand the whole concept.  However, an hour later it just now dawned on me (hey, I've been working a lot of hours!) and I must say, the ending is quite good; right up there with The Sixth Sense.  Addressed to the rainmaker: please make some rain tomorrow between 6 and 11PM!  Thank you!</td>

      <td>I've recently been accused of 'leaving Christianity for a mess of pottage' by a conservative Lutheran, mainly because of the things I say on this blog.  I think I agree with Luther on most things, especially his definition of faith:  'Instead, faith is God's work in us, that changes us and gives new birth from God. (John 1:13). It kills the Old Adam and makes us completely different people. It changes our hearts, our spirits, our thoughts and all our powers. It brings the Holy Spirit with it. Yes, it is a living, creative, active and powerful thing, this faith. Faith cannot help doing good works constantly. It doesn't stop to ask if good works ought to be done, but before anyone asks, it already has done them and continues to do them without ceasing.  Anyone who does not do good works in this manner is an unbeliever.  He stumbles around and looks for faith and good works, even though he does not know what faith or good works are. Yet he gossips and chatters about faith and good works with many words.  'Faith is a living, bold trust in God's grace, so certain of God's favor that it would risk death a thousand times trusting in it. Such confidence and knowledge of God's grace makes you happy, joyful and bold in your relationship to God and all creatures. The Holy Spirit makes this happen through faith. Because of it, you freely, willingly and joyfully do good to everyone, serve everyone, suffer all kinds of things, love and praise the God who has shown you such grace. Thus, it is just as impossible to separate faith and works as it is to separate heat and light from fire! Therefore, watch out for your own false ideas and guard against good-for-nothing gossips, who think they're smart enough to define faith and works, but really are the greatest of fools. Ask God to work faith in you, or you will remain forever without faith, no matter what you wish, say or can do.'  More thoughts later... I just wanted you all to see that Luther had a place for sanctification, even more than I initially thought in my post last week.</td>

      <td>Ah Bri...sorry about today ...  this morning...all of this afternoon. Sometimes my emotions cannot handle being criticised, especially so unfairly, and I know why I reacted the way I did. I didn't have to...but I have a strange hostility against injustice ....and mixed with insecurity of being criticised by someone whom you want to be perfect for...and mixed with the fact   that we only have 5 days to get a new address   Aahhh my idealised brain and my chemical feelings, just cracked. It was also a very hot day. Listen to me justifying it ... but thanks for today anyways. I know it wasn't fun.  Hmmm...There are days, where I all I do is berate myself (stress makes for self criticism) for doing just silly things, and since I always think it's my fault...it's awful hearing someone saying it in such a crude and impatient way....much like I said to you...I've grown up with harsh abusive words all my life, from someone I love (Mum)...I don't need it again from my boyfriend. I just fucking lost it. Especially since he was just obviously taking it out on me. Panic, Stress, Disillusionment...you name it, and it was felt today. At least we talked and figured it out, and he was genuine upset, because again...he didn't know why it hurt (why are men so stupid?) and it took Vixs to spell it out for him. Ahhh men. I am sending you a big HUG and I hope you have fun tomorrow!! Thanks again! So...onto other news...what's with The Job? Well I am a receptionist at a College, I get to hang out with students from overseas...this is very promising. It pays well and it's dead easy work. So I'm set, AND since I'm a voracious workaholic, this suits me fine. Don't snort, I am. Ask anyone, ask Been! It's all so good, because I want to make friends with a tiny Japanese girl... I figure she can get me into the country and I can spend endless hours in Japanese Anime HEAVEN. Ah the Japanese...with their great food, horrible teas and a graceful and dignified history...I really can't wait. But most of all...I want to visit Tokyo and the Japanese country side.. me and CB, relaxing with a pipe and good ale underneath Mount Fuji. I like that vision. Shit yeah.  And so what if the job isn't artistic? I'm not artistic when I'm starving! I can assure you of that! No one is going to tell me I can't have overseas Sea Taffy and overseas Italian handcrafted water colour brushes. So I'm materialistic and I love good food. Who am I justifying this to? Ah yeah I have been reading Purple Bitch again and her justification on just about everything in her life is kinda infectious. It's hilarious how they dance, in their interpretation hell. Fucking idiots. You know, that one particular boring piece of shit, the stupid one? Yeah the one that is rubbing her hands because SHE knows it's her, and actually LIKES the fact people are spitting in her face...yeah the one that calls homosexuals fags, and thinks it's clever. She is so hungry for attention it makes me want to spit bile. And what's with Purple Bitch? she only feels anger when she feels indignant? What the fuck is that? She should just say the truth, it's so much fucking simpler because once she says it she will realise what a godamn fool she is being.  Purple Bitch:  I love him. I love him so much because I just do. He is my everything. And it doesn't matter how much he hurts me because I love him and he loves me. He loves me so much. (rolls eyes.. really, how many fucking times can she say that? Does she think that just by saying it, she will magically feel it?) He knows how much he hurt me and is hurting too. He hurts so much that when he said he 'never meant for it to happen' he meant 'he never really wanted to tell me but thought that Jamie would let it slip, so to save his ass he spat out the truth, twisting it cleverly through manipulation'....and isn't the truth and being honest a lot better than fucking another girl without my permission and NOT telling me?? I must fight this! *delete accounts of people spewing truth* *ignore posts which point out things like...* I like this quote so it will get a FULL paragraph  when you say 'our' private hells, does that really apply to both you and he or just you? it seems like the only stress he has to deal with is the guilt of doing as he pleases.  Oh fucking brilliant! That was posted by  urlLink tristanwolf  who's site is a complete drivel, but this line makes me immediately respect him, and she ignored it!!! In the background of her mind, Steve's sleazy voice must murmur...'Oh Lauren.. I hurt so much because you hurt. I know I've been bad. Please Forgive Me...it will never happen again...last time I said that I was uh...stupid, not realising how much I truly love you...blah, blah,  phew. He got off easy. And he will keep on getting off easy. Because she replays JUST THAT in her mind, over and over again. She said it herself, that's all she's holding onto. Not realising that 15-20 people that I know, (that's people that *I* know, and I'm 1 person!!!) read her journal and giggle and shake their head in silent pity. She actually thinks people are there to support her, they aren't. They are there to validate their existence, that's why read it. You don't understand the concept of 'validate?' Then get the fuck off my blog. IQ required, sweetie. We all look at our mostly happy and content (well...fucking REALISTIC more like it) relationships and think...shit. I'm so lucky. Sure I may want to tear their hair out sometimes, because they are human!! but betrayal? Shit girl...no one on this side of reality will take that crap. I never got her anyways, you know that she can't appreciate music through sound? That's fucked up! It's all just words to her, so if she doesn't understand what they are saying, she ain't interested! That's my theory anyways, on why she likes John Mayer and Matchbox 20 and not The White Stripes or The Strokes, because in the realm of poetry and fucking meaning, The White Stripes/Stokes have a lot more art and passion in their words than...well...you know, drivel pop rock) Actually I want to talk about that for a minute..because music is a big part of anyone's life, it's what we feed our soul, are we looking into another's soulful expression? of bland rock crap? Let's see a sample of Matchbox 20 lyrics:  She says it's cold outside and she hands me a raincoat She's always worried about things like that  She says it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault   *blink* She feels insecure about the relationship because you are distant? It's poetic...ssssuuuure....but here is The Strokes taking that situation and adding some truth to it:  Is this it? Is this it? Is this it? Can't you see I'm trying, I don't even like it  I just lie to get to your apartment  Now I'm staying there just for a while  I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired   Now that's a true poetic expression of distant...from a   man's   point of view. Not some little boy with a corporate cock in his mouth. How is art trying to decipher what the other person is feeling? Why do people constantly do that? They justify how THEY feel and then colour everyone's emotions accordingly?! I'm angry! therefore you must be apologetic and grovelling! IT'S YOUR FAULT. You must react to MY EMOTIONS as they happen, how I EXPECT it. *Rolls eyes* Jamie didn't give a fuck about fucking Steve, because she doesn't think (snort) Sex has any emotional attachment (she must think to herself that old Phrase 'Sex and Love, two different things who like to wear each other's shoes for awhile, you know, Love disguised as Sex, and Sex disguised as Love', although perhaps she doesn't know it yet. ANYWAYS. She didn't give a fuck, so? Why crucify her for it? She's entitled. If you want to say to her. YOU BETRAYED ME. Then why are you willing to share your man with her? You are fighting this aren't you?  How?  Are you telling Steve baby, amidst sulks and tears, don't sleep with her anymore...I don't trust her. As if it's her fault? Oh baby...Oh darling, please don't ever close your blog! This is like Reality TV only more incredible, since I have met you! And I STILL can't believe a person like you exists!  Ha. What a sap. Those who succeed are those who demand understanding and respect. I'm angry! Do you understand? Don't try to reason with me, for I can't see reason in your argument! I feel fucking hurt, I feel dejected and used. I feel LIED TO. And this is love? IS THIS LOVE? IS THIS IT??? Ha. No way...no way. It's just too zany for me. And if this gets out, and that stupid troll decides it's her BUSINESS...bring it on fuckface. A strolling Bovine like yourself...your head will look great on a stick. I need a cigarette, everyone here wants me to join their circle, I have to go upstairs and pack eventually, but I think I will sit around the living room, vodka in one hand and good conversation. I will miss the girls...it's going to be so weird without them. Hey did I mention that there is an apartment right above Been's apartment that is for lease? How awesome!

Maybe if I stop watching it altogether, the teams I want to win will actually do so…Nobody talks about the game the next day anyway; they only want to talk about the commercials. But since I didn’t watch the Super Bowl, here are some other commercials I like (see how I’m scraping for blog subjects?):  -“WHERE’S THE BEEF?!” Still the best.  -The one where the guy is sniffling, sneezing, headache, cough, etc. That guy looks like crap.  -The Hose Roller thing where the “Other Guy” keeps fumbling with his hose, eventually dropping it, whereas the lady next to him has that Hose Roller thing and can do it with one hand. Note how the guy also has an untucked shirt and ratty hair. He just can’t keep ANYTHING together!  -I miss the Pets.com dog.  -You know, the one where the mother in the family is all happy to be doing the laundry or the dishes or making breakfast that no one has time to sit down and eat? But thank goodness she spent X dollars on the brand name version of X that somehow makes banal chores like cleaning up after, feeding, and washing her family (something they should really learn how to do by themselves) just plain magical.

The Delhi High court in a judgement today acquitted all public servants including Rajiv Gandhi from the Bofors Scandal. Most of the prime Accused in the case are already dead. I am wondering how the judge felt announcing a verdict acquitting a person who has been dead for 13 years now. How ridiculous is that ?? The Indian Legal system with its Lakhs of pending cases needs a complete overhaul. Imagine a Judge sitting in the Chair and announcing in 2004  ' I pronounce as Guilty Mr.X for the Theft he committed on August 30th , 1987 in the Y case ' . Come on , give us a break.                        When Arun Jaitley , an eminent lawyer himself , took over as the Law Minister a few years back there were lots of expectations that the legal system would be modified to deliver swift decisions which are of chronological relevance. But nothing much seemed to have Changed.                                         It is said 'Justice delayed is Justice Denied' .

So do I care enough to keep the updates on the DMCA coming into my email box? Do I care enough to make myself care when those around me could care less?

I had the first moment of something good I haven't felt in a long time, longer than I can remember. I'm not sure how exactly to describe the feeling. maybe a combination of contentment, happiness, optimism, peace - something warm and shining and pure that gleamed in my heart's eye like a pearl formed around a splinter of obsidian. I know I'm waxing goth-melodramatic here, and I hope that you will forgive me for it, but that's really what it felt like.

So I searched my room for the culprit, mining through every drawer and shelf until I had almost given up.  I started a new load of laundry, sprayed all of my socks with perfume, and decided to try my closet once again.  So I knelt down at the shoes, perfume in hand, and began at the right.  First my prom hells, my pumas, my combat/bowling shoe thingys, and then I came to my beloved boots.   I checked the right one, no sign of any unusual smell, but I knew I was getting closer.  Then I saw, on the left one, a small gray ball stuck to the top.  I thought it might just be a dust bunny.  Or maybe my cat threw up on my shoe. Ew, that's it, that's the problem.  So I hold my breath as I pull the shoe out into the light, and then I see it.  What I believed to be a hairball is actually a mouse.  A dead mouse.  My mind flickers back to a vague memory in which my mom told me about a month ago that she saw a mouse in her room, but she never heard from it again. So now, it's a month old, rotting carcas of a mouse, stuck to my boot.  And these are my rocky boots! My knee high vinyl boots! My boots that make me look like a sex goddess!  At this point I stop the Spoiled-City-Girl panic over my ruined boots, and start the Spoiled-City-Girl panic of trying to find someone else to clean up the mess.  My mom, the lovely Farm Girl she is, reluctantly volunteered, not realizing how decomposed this mouse really is.  I'm in the hallway, halfway to fainting, when my mom runs into the kitchen to dispose of the thing.  We washed off my boots with a disgusted look on our faces the whole time, and my closet is now locked in a Febreezed haze until I desperately need to get in there.  Possibly when I start packing for college.  And the clincher:  This terrible stench that surrounded the back of my apartment smelled quite similar to old, rotted cheese.</td>

      <td>Well, I think summer is finally here. The temperature has been hovering in the mid- to upper-twenties all week, although the humidity has made it seem much warmer. I look forward to summer so much during our long, cold Canadian winters, all the while [conveniently] forgetting that I don't really like hot weather. Now that it is here, I find myself lying prone on the couch with no plans to move until autumn rolls around.     One thing I do love about summer is the food. I love going to the grocery store and seeing the big bins full of watermelons, the wonderful displays of berries and cherries, the lovely fresh herbs and leafy lettuces, blushing peaches, and stacks of farm-fresh corn. The lush produce available now makes my weekly trip to the market a pleasure ....... the air conditioning is a welcome treat, too!    There are certain foods that I always associate with summer. I was thinking about this last night and I find it amusing that so many of my fondest memories are tied up with food and cooking. My summer foods are:        Rhubarb - my father's all-time favorite dessert was rhubarb pie. We had a big rhubarb patch in our backyard that was THE local hangout for the neighborhood cats. Whenever anyone approached the patch, cats would explode out of it and run off in all directions. It was enough to give a person a heart attack if you weren't expecting it. LOL     Lemonade and iced tea - I think the reason I am partial to lemonade is because I love the Country Time Lemonade commercials ...... 'summer will be a short 54 days this year' [unless you're in Canada, then it's only 27 days, lol]. I like my lemonade with mint and there is a fantastic recipe for Pineapple Mint Lemonade in The Vegetarian Gourmet: Easy Lowfat Favorites by Bobbie Hinman.     Corn on the cob - I remember having corn with my father one night when I was young. My cob had a hole in it and I told my father I wasn't eating it because there was a worm in it. He insisted there wasn't. The corn had been boiled and if there had been a worm, he was dead in the bottom of the pot [lovely dinner conversation, eh?]. I went to take a bite and out popped a little worm. Needless to say, I did not finish dinner that night! Years later, I repeated this story to my children. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of telling it at dinner while we were having corn. I thought it was really funny. My kids were not amused and neither one of them would eat the corn!     Peaches - my son's favorite fruit. Not a summer goes by that I don't make something with fresh peaches. Peaches are also my cousin's favorite for pie. Pastry-making is not an art I excel at; yet never does a summer pass without someone asking me to bake a pie. What is it with people and pie? Why can't they all like crumbles or cake or anything that doesn't involve pastry?  Black Forest cake - now this is not a food that most people would associate with hot summer days, and you're probably thinking it's a misprint, but it isn't. My birthday falls in the middle of July and when I was growing up, my father would buy me a Black Forest cake every year for my birthday. Now I make my own fat-free, low-sugar, vegan Black Forest cake. I think it's even better than the bakery version, and I look forward to it so much that I don't even mind turning on the oven and heating up the kitchen!    I do have many more foods that I and my children enjoy all summer long, but those five stand out in my mind. I wonder which foods my children will have fond memories of when they grow up?</td>

Me:  No, why there’s a version that’s $60 bucks? Is it even longer?  Edwin:  No, but it comes with bookmarks.  Me:  Oh…(puzzled look on my face). They’re freakin’ charging $30 more for bookmarks?   Edwin:  Yeah…  Me:  Okay, that’s dumb…(5 minutes of silence pass cuz I’m still wondering why you’d pay $60 just for bookmarks). Are they gold-plated?  Edwin:  What?  Me:  The bookmarks?   Edwin:  No. They’re just bookmarks. They look like stone.  Me:  Oh okay…(Stone? still puzzled. 5 more minutes pass)…Why the hell would you pay $30 extra for bookmarks? Must be like a set of collectible ones huh?  Edwin:  Naw, they’re just bookmarks. There’s two of them. Remember that part when they’re on the boat going down the river and they see the huge statues of the former kings and they’re like this to each other?

So I give them a light misting after every water treatment. Just to keep them fresh looking. My blueberrys arent giving me much, but I expect them to get use to where they are within the upcoming weeks. I am so excited to get those bushes strong and fertile. My purple sage is also thriveing quite well. They didnt take as long as all the other herbs to recoop. Infact I wish that all my other herbs did as well as the sage did. They where only in shock mode for about 3 days. My catnip has gone to the cats. I think that If I dont see them start to grow I am just going to take them out and replace them with another herb. It is a waster to keep somthing there that just attracts annoying strays. I will grow it in my window seil. This isnt about the garden but I got a really prety Betta about a day ago.

Ever since Nick Berg's death, I have been fascinated with the concept of how individuals can do this to other human beings. The thought boggles my mind.  How do you take a screaming, kicking, pleading person, someone with a family, friends, hopes, and dreams, and saw his head off?  How do you sleep?  How do you eat?  How do you go home to your family?  I watched the Nick Berg video and some of the other videos available on the net that document cases of torture (stoning, even impaling someone on a stake), and my mind can't grasp the brutality and lack of humanity involved in such an act.  Even more distressing are the number of people who turn out to cheer on such events.  Now we have 2 more executed men - Paul Johnson, and Kim Sung-Ill, a Korean.  The families who are left to wait in agony, knowing the outcome of their loved ones' fate, knowing there will be pictures and videos released of the horrendous last moments of life, how do they cope?  How do you exist?  Whom do you blame?  There will be no trials for the families to attend, there will be no executions to watch, there will be no closure.  There will only be a casket which can't be opened.  I believe that the war in Iraq is a good thing, if any war can be said to be good.  I support our President and our troops.  I know that sometimes the greater good can be lost in the shuffle of the everyday.  Relieving Iraq of Saddam  was  a good thing; giving Iraq a democratic sytstem of government  is  a good thing.

      <td>So, I just had a wonderfully delicious conversation with Amanda. That child is simply amazing to me. So different, yet so exactly the same. She is what I would be...had I the guts to do so. Waiting for Abs to call...I signed off while typing this...my conversation with Amanda left me connected past our usual phone call time of 9pm. I've already talked to her once this evening...I'm not all that worried. I've realized a several things in the past month or so...  The matriarch~ I need to talk to my mother. In theory to help start our healing process. I so badly want to connect with her. I really hope that I can. I just have to remember that her insults and put downs have nothing to do with me. They are all about her. They serve a purpose for her and pin pointing that purpose, will help to resolve these issues. If I can just have a chance to talk with her. To really talk...perhaps things can work out for the better...  The patriarch~ This weekend, Abigail accompanied my father to Cleveland to help pack up most of my stuff. I tried to stay 'stoic' and 'straight' but it simply didn't happen. It had only been a week since I had seen her, but still I couldn't be *that* close and not express my feelings. Dad seemed to take it in stride. We acted mostly as if we were around her parents...it was nice...no it was fabulous to be that honest in front of my father and it was wonderful to know that he was at the very least, trying not to show any discomfort he might have, and the most, not even having any discomfort.   The sibling~ I wonder how the parents are dealing with Michele's boy. I almost envy the relationship she carries with them. Hell, it can't be much fun from her point of view, but all that making fun and teasing, is something I never had. I hope she knows how significant it is. I'd like to think that she never had a problem with the whole 'gay' thing. She was barely surprised when I told and for the most part has been nothing but supportive since. To me. However, I have a feeling it's still a bit of a sore spot with her. Something she doesn't want to admit, so as not to be seen as some sort of outsider to her peers. I'm not sure she's explained everything to this Matt boy yet. I hope that she does, and I hope that she realizes that, in the end, someone who can't accept me, is simply not worthy of her heart.   This whole gay thing~ I'm realizing just how large a part of ones life their sexuality is and that if they don't match those around them, it's hard to connect on any other level. The relationship I have with my gay friends is entirely different than that of my straight friends. Sexuality is rarely a topic amongst those who 'family'. Sure, there's boys talking about boyfriends and girls about girlfriends, but these are simply taken in stride. I am simply me and I am part of the whole. Around straight friends the air is slightly heavier and a large sign is placed over my head. 'DYKE' I am gay. I am constantly reminded of this and sometimes almost feel I have to prove that I really am a lesbian. Somehow the conversation is always steered back to sexuality and no matter where I was before, I'm pointed to as the outsider. It's strange really, and something I plan to study further over winter break. I'll let you know if I come up with anything...  10pm~ Haven't heard from Abigail yet...perhaps I should start to worry...nah...if she was alone in Cincy, I would, but as she's in Dayton this evening, there are plenty of other things and people to distract her. I'm glad she has her family. I'm glad *I* have her family. In the end, I'm glad I have mine too. I have them to thank for the person I have become.   10:45pm~ Abby called, we had a good talk. Discussed Reno and Amanda, and the fact that while we have a problem with Reno's drinking, we don't with Amanda's. A combination of our trust in her, and the fact that while perhaps it brings her down a notch or two, she's still too high up for one to notice. :-) Reno's just frightfully irresponsible and immature. I hope that one day she gains the wisdom to regret some of her actions. I spose that's enough random babble from me for tonight. I should probably head off to sleep now, or at least do something productive such as...well...packing. I need to do that. I also need to figure out what I'm going to do with the damn mattress and box spring. *sigh* Like I said...I'm outta here...</td>

      <td>Democrats will undoubtedly look at a  urlLink new poll  from the Washington Post, showing support leaning heavily towards Kerry (a 60/30 split, with other 10 going Nader or undecided).  Views on issues generally favor the Dems (Bush only polls over 50% on his handling of the War on Terror), saying the Administration's policies on all issues are failing.   Of some long-term interest, and some good news for the GOP, are the number of Latino Dems who become Republicans (some 34% as opposed to 11% going the other way) and that more independents or Dems are defecting to Bush for the election, since only 18% of those polled identified themselves as Republicans.  So, while Dems start from a big advantage, inroads can and have been made. So, is this a problem for the President?  Well, he won with only 35% of the Latino vote in 2000, so it looks like he'll get about the same this year.  While it must be a bit disheartening - particularly since the GOP has undertaken some serious outreach towards the Hispanic community and because the B-C campaign was hoping to get at least 40% of the Latino vote - it might just mean a tighter election than Bush would have liked. What's the solution for the GOP?  Good question.  Dems will always be more willing to pander than Republicans (although this Administration has tried to outdo them, to little effect).  Appealing to religious and/or cultural values is one avenue to continue to explore.  And some of the problems this year are due things that are unique (the recession, the War in Iraq).  In fact, one positive (from the GOP point-of-view) way to look at the results is that, even with only moderate support for the Administration, with the economic hits the Hispanic community took during the recession and with the growing unpopularity of the Iraq War, it is actually a good sign that general support for the Administration and the GOP has not fallen.  While this may come across as wishful thinking, note that 21% of those who say they are voting for Kerry could change their votes for someone else - or, in my read, differing circumstances.</td>

      <td>Molly Ivins was asked about how Democrats had managed to lose the culture war.  What is the nature of this singular inability of Democratic rhetoric to create new forms or reach compromises capable of winning larger voting pools?  The liberal consensus (at least among my dear and educated friends) seems to be: these people are stupid and ignorant, they have selfish values or are in the sway of cults, if say things to woo them we will ultimately compromise our values.  Of course this is not the issue – the issue is figuring out how to speak in the same soundbites as Republicans, with efficient plug, actually taking the –real- issues (how the Republicans have effectively dismantled the education, welfare, health, and employment system) into the same forcefulness that Bush has.  Bush on NPR this morning on his judicial appointees: “This isn’t right, and it isn’t fair.”  Now there’s a loaded sentence.  But the plug!  A total non-issue!  The conviction of a four-year-old!  So Ivins was talking about Gingrich circulating a list of ten adjectives that he suggested Republicans use against democrats, including most notably “godless,” “anti-family,” and “bizarre.”  It was a great list.  Imagine the efficiency of every Republican speaking with a coherent agenda, painting a coherent picture of a disabled other party, which the other party never refutes.    I asked our friends what an equivalent list would be for Republicans.  Their answers are telling: “zealots.”  “money-grubbing.” “elitist.” “corporate pigs.”  Is this the year 1962?  Do you or I or anyone else after the class of 1990 really have a coherent vision of what a “money grubbing corporate pig” is?  Or is the left any clearer of charges of “zeal” and “elitism”?  It seems more like the kind of phrase that good humor lampoons.    I’ve been thinking about this all night.  Efficiency of communication is a wonderful thing.  Recognizing that the American middle trusts a rhetoric of prayer to indicate a posture that a political candidate believes in an internal life is an important thing.  Quickly striking up an emotion, telling a story without good reasoning, reeducating the masses about history. So important, before the lack of an education system in America makes the divide between who gets the whole story in politics and who doesn’t becomes any worse.  My revised list:   “hyper-emotional” “anti-education.” “militant” “truth-disabled” “unfair.” “spin-masters.”  It is, after all, as if the educated are waging a war against the clever voted in by the uneducated.   And yet the educated aren’t clever enough to figure out how to undo it.</td>

Given the strong presence of community college faculty in the academy, it is essential that colleges develop institutional programs and policies that enhance community college teaching and learning. To be effective, these programs need to take into account the differing backgrounds, perspectives, and goals of community college faculty.   This Digest, drawn from 'Community College Faculty: Characteristics, Practices, and Challenges'(New Directions for Community Colleges, Summer 2002), summarizes research findings on the similarities and differences among community college faculty groups and concludes with a discussion of how this information can be used to increase the relevance and effectiveness of faculty development initiatives.

      <td>urlLink      urlLink      I'm in a fair bit of a quandary. I really want to tell my friends about this blog, but I also want to be myself here. Obviously if my friends came here, even if I used different names, they could figure out who I was talking about.  Technically, I'm a senior now. The seniors aren't in school - actually, they left on their senior trip already - so we're the oldest. We already infested the senior hallway. Finals also start day after tomorrow. Then I have SAT IIs as well. Then it's off to Spain for a week.  Boy, my life is boring at the moment. I wanted to keep a regular posting up, though. I e-mailed Phil, though. Hopefully everything's cool with him. If not, well then there's not much I can do about it. He may not even have access to a computer for all I know. You know, he was one of the few things keeping his brother in line, in my opinion. I could be wrong, as I didn't know them really well, but that's the impression I got from my first meetings with the two.  Apparently two of my friends that hated each other finally decided to stop pretending to endure each other. I'm not sure whether they're speaking or not. It happened in an Art class I didn't go to because I was done with my piece. It wasn't so much what she did, I don't think, as that he had a lot of rage saved up, and it just all let out with her moving the pieces. I'm actually...on neither of their sides, really. Both do have a rather large self-image. I apologize if either of them find this page, but you both do sometimes at least say things that suggest high self-regard. I love you both though, and respect that you don't get along. Actually, I'm not even that close with either of you. Wish I could've been there when the roof blew off, though.  I only have to take three written finals: math, bio, English. Then I have my art meeting on Monday to critique our pieces. I would prefer if he didn't do it in front of the rest of the class, but we can't have everything. I just have to finish this second piece and then go back to work on the first. I'm not sure either's brilliant, but they'll do, suppose. As I said earlier, I can't do Monet in like two weeks. I could probably never do Monet, but that's not really the point. You know, I'm not completely satisfied with any of my concentration ideas, but I have the whole summer and part of the fall to work it out.  Here, have some parsley potpourri for your time. Namaste.</td>

      <td>When you get a tan, what is actually happening is that the  melanocytes  are producing  melanin pigment  in reaction to ultraviolet light in sunlight.  Ultraviolet light stimulates melanin production.  The pigment has the effect of  absorbing the UV radiation in sunlight, so it protects the cells from UV damage.   Melanin production takes a fair amount of time - that is why most people cannot get a tan in one day. You have to expose yourself to UV for a short period of time to activate the melanocytes. They produce melanin over the course of hours. By repeating this process over 5 to 7 days pigment builds up in your cells to a level that is protective. The previous paragraph applies to Caucasians. In a variety of other races melanin production is continuous, so the skin is always pigmented to some degree. In these races the incidence of skin cancer is much lower because cells are constantly protected from UV radiation by melanin. Melanocytes actually produce two different pigments: eumelanin (brown) and phaeomelanin (yellow and red). Red heads happen to produce more phaeomelanin and less eumelanin, which is why they don't tan very well.     Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)  is produced by the  pituitary gland.  MSH flows through the bloodstream and reaches the melanocytes, encouraging them to produce more melanin (for example, a person injected with a large dose of MSH will get darker). The pituitary gland is actually quite interesting - it is tied into the optic nerve, which means that it can sense light.</td>

      <td>Okay.. for starters.. lemme just say that John Buccigross is a great guy... he has a great sense of humor and I think he sees things on the  right  side - if ya know what I mean.  The Stanley Cup Playoffs begins tomorrow night and people and pundits are ringing in with their predictions. I think I'll do the same.    Eastern Conference    Ottawa v. NY Islanders Ottawa enters in with a few negatives. 1. The President's Trophy winners don't have an above average chance to win it all. The Detroit Red Wings were the first team to break that curse last year. 2. Ottawa is still strapped for cash, they need to win to earn more money. 3. Alexei Yashin is an Islander now. Their once top pick has come back wearing a new uniform. The Islanders have proven that they can win, but dealing Osgood to St. Louis will prove to be their downfall.  Prediction: Ottawa in 6   New Jersey vs. Boston Boston's managerial and upper management got a shake up when they fired Robie Ftorek their coach and the GM is now sitting in temporary. Glen Murray and the B's have been on a mission all season long to return the once proud franchise back to it's legendary status, New Jersey is riding on the hot goalie in Martin Brodeur. They also contain a lot of veterans from Dallas in a blockbuster trade a while back. The Devils are the experienced playoff franchise. Sorry Beantown, you'll get 'em next year.  Prediction: Devils in 5   Tampa Bay vs. Washington If you asked who the higher seed is in this series, you'd be surprised that Tampa Bay won the Southeastern division over their rivals Washington. Tampa has been quietly making waves thanks to their good goaltending in Graham and Khabibulin. Jaromir Jagr is 'dying alive' with his skills in Washington and fighting the discomforting process of healing a broken wrist. Peter Bondra scored 2 goals in their last regular season game. Look for the Caps and my Uncle (in the PR office) to find a lightning rod and control the young and inexperienced 'Bolts.  Prediction: Capitals in 4    Philadelphia vs. Toronto The two teams taht made the major deals to re-tool and improve for a serious playoff run find themselves against one another in the first round. Roenick has his buddy Amonte back and are playing well. Hitchcock has coached the Stanley Cup Stars; he knows what it takes to make it for the long haul. Toronto awaits their return on investment with goalie Ed Belfour and RW Owen Nolan. The Leafs look stronger and battle tested than Flyers goaltender Checkmanek. The Flyers are looking at another first round exit if Amonte and Roenick can't score.  Prediction: Maple Leafs in 7  .    Western Conference   Dalas vs. Edmonton The Stars were the best team in the Western Conference earning the home ice advantage throughout the playoffs. The new world Oilers retooled themselves for a better showing in the playoffs this year. Dvorak for Carter will prove that it was a lopsided trade in favor of New York. Tommy Salo treats every shot like a sweedish meatball. Dalas has the kind of firepower to knock a few of those back in on 2nd and 3rd tries.  Prediction: Stars in 6   Detroit vs Anaheim The Mighty Ducks are the surprise team in the playoffs. Led by Peter Sykora and Paul Karya, Anaheim is a scoring threat that could hold their own. However, Detroit is a team that has the right mix of age and youth. They can score like water off a mallard's back. Brett Hull scored over 700 goals for his career this season and won't hesitate to score some more. Detroit is the defending champions and will play like that through the series. Curtis Joseph is trying to achieve what he couldn't for Edmonton or Toronto. Maybe the agless veterans on Detroit's team all retire at once for going out on top.  Prediction: Wings in 4   Colorado vs. Minnesota In a surprising turn of events, the Minnesota Wild fought hard to get a playoff berth in only their third season. The young team is lead by Slovak phenom Marian Gaborik and the defensive trap system. Colorado had a bum year losing Joe Sakic for most of the first part of the season due to injury. Patrick Roy hasn't looked like his old self this year and even let the team down when Minnesota won a few games at their expense. This is a tough call because Minnesota is good enough to shock some people, but Colorado has the dominant team.  Prediction: Avalanche in 6   Vancouver vs. St. Louis It's put up or shut up for Vancouver. The hottest team in the league scoring wise is Vancouver with Bertuzzi, Naslund and Brendan Morrison as the saviors of most fantasy leauge teams. They gave the defending champs Detroit a run for their money last year in the playoffs and the fans support their efforts to give it another go. St. Louis stands in their way this year bringing back captain Chris Pronger from injury. The Blues were treading water with the goaltending they had only to pick up Chris Osgood at the trading deadline. Also, look for newly acquired Mr. Candice Cameron (Valerie Bure) to make an impact in the playoffs.  Prediction: Cannucks in 5</td>

Ive come to the realization that Im much more cynical and foreboding now than I ever was in the past. I dont really think thats a good thing.  Its a materialistic world out there. So I just stopped caring as a response. Ive realized that and I find myself to be a cold individual right now as a result of that or at least on the inside. I still go out and have fun with friends. I still enjoy life; however, on the inside many of my desires and ideals have stopped burning brightly. I think thats why the thought of an enduring romantic relationship seems ridiculous to me. Thats probably why I found that stuff in the films Ive been watching to be meaningless. Thats probably why Im feeling so apathetic right now about grad school and my future. I wouldnt say that Im pessimistic to the point of not having hope at all, but simply at this juncture, I have no lofty dreams like I did several years ago.   Thats pretty much my ramble.

      <td>A good writer always works at the impossible ~John Stienbeck   Its finally time to get on with my writing.  Matt and I have resolved to write every day for four hours, even if were doing research or outlining, were working for 4 hours a day, as of now that is.  In the future it will probably grow to be more time per day, but neither of us have held a job in years so were trying to get back into the swing of things.  I figure that someday I will be a professional writer as soon as I get something published, that is- and a professional writer has to be devoted to his/her job, as a job.   Professional writers, generally writing from a home office, have to be devoted enough to sit down at their computer every single day and write, weather they want to or not.  So we are trying to treat writing like a job and I have a good feeling about our approach, I have the feeling like Its going to work out for the best, for both of us.  I am even going so far as to keep a Writing Schedule of the time per day/week/month that we work at our writing.  I figure that in a real job everyone keeps time cards and such, so we are too.   I created a form on Excel that allows me to write the month, day, and time in/out that was worked.    I even have a great idea for a book, now I am just onto the writing process, which for me is a huge step.  I am one of those people who need structure in this process.  I need to outline and research, and outline some more.  When all the outlining is done, and the research is as complete as it can be, then the book gets written, and only then!  Though I have to say that there was a time when I believed in just sitting in front of the computer and writing.  I know people whom employ this technique and it works great, but I am definitely not one of them.  I require more organization.  I think its a matter of insecurity with the whole process, seeing is that I have never done it before.  Perhaps in the future I will become more comfortable with just sitting and writing first, plotting and organization later, but I doubt it.  The further into the process I get, the more I am going to come to rely on this preparation before I can write.  I honestly believe there is nothing wrong with that.  Everyone needs something; organization and preparation are what I need.    So wish me luck as I embark on new ground.  Sadly I cannot tell you what Im writing about, but when its done I hope yall will read it!  Chalk it up to paranoia   ~Kristyn</td>

You try for about five minutes to get it lighted (and see the magical fire they show within), only to be crushed by the lack of fuel...  -  Sleeeeepy time.</td>

      <td>And yet once again, the age-old theory that men think with the little head rather than the big head, is once again proven correct.  Marc Anthony married J.Lo (who the hell hasn't?!) this weekend.  He traded in the classy Miss Universe for the 'Jenny who's been around the block and then some'???  Yup.  The power of pussy once again prevails!!  I will never understand why men will choose to have everyone else's sloppy seconds.  I think that if all else fails...maybe I should try to get in good with J.Lo.  Try to become her #1 wedding planner.  Shit, with a job like that...I'd be set for life.  Hell, she gets married like every five years right?</td>

      <td>The Last Samurai.   Alright, all you real asians can stop gagging now.  Look, all, I hate to sound like one of those 'our women' kind of chauvanist pigs, but let's face it.  This is yet another movie along the lines of Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas, among others, about a white man hooking it up with an exotic woman and culture.    This is nothing more than yet another fantasy film, in this case, with a fuckin' asian fetishist playwright who is a little too into the martial arts samurai fantasy.   Asian women are the new 'hot alien star trek babe,' that is to say, a conquest, a trick, like joining the mile high club.  Most of the time, men just see some asian women as attractive.  And as a fellow fan, I can't blame them.  In fact, it's good taste, IMO.  But seriously, others are just fetishists or worse, out for some exotic ass.  Consider the difference between The Transporter and say, Romeo Must Die, or Replacement Killers.  Asian men are still sexless martial artists, and I don't expect that to change overnight.  Asian women, however, just fawn over a white boy.  And don't think this is square on the shoulders of the white man.  There is many a sellout banana woman out there who's responsible for this.  Congratulations, you're now not a dragon lady, just a trophy girlfriend next to the mile-high club membership.  I hope you're glad.    Certainly, I understand that being in the old culture sometimes meant second class citizenship.  I know that some Asian guys are jerks and assholes and treat their women badly.  Well guess what, that's your fault for dating these losers and punks.    Look, people, part of my vitriol is as a result of past experience, but to be honest, I'm sick of this Asian exoticism shit.  Women, y'all are the most beautiful creatures on God's green Earth, and I recommend you stop letting people treat you like just another Geisha.  If you have any respect at all for the tradition and culture, don't go see the Last Samurai.    And if you really want to see it, at least don't pay full price for it.  And if you really want me to bow down in awe and respect, yell out 'when is Ken Watanabe gonna hook up with the blonde with big knockers?!'</td>

      <td>Today at work, i drew a pie chart to try to understand my feelings. They consisted of aspiration, realisation, disappointment, spanner and one more negative feeling i which i forgot. Right, my day was actually interesting per se'. This morning i went to meet a client, where bumbling moi messed up big time. Forgot to take signatures and shit.FUCK! The other thing, i got my senior in trouble by messing up an appointment. I fucked up big time again. Then came the 2nd appointment with another HNWI. That went well, i guess. Maybe i am overreacting. But, i will clean up my mess soon enough. You start it, you end it! Enuff said. I helped Tee buy a Pc over the weekend, and the fucking computer technician twat forgot to install the dvdrom. I was like wat the fuck!! Then, i called up the shop, and Tee without my knowledge went to have it fixed. Fine. Then i am now thinking. I need to sober up big time now! I need to discipline myself big time, I need to SOBER UP! It's like i have been drinking for so long now. Think faster, move faster, Lie better! FUck... I need to learn to Cover my Ass well enough. NUFF said. I will pray later before i sleep for strength, for discipline.  Oh yeah, wot's new about the chick i am into. Everytime i get into deep shit, i feel damn guilty and i know now, that i will have to grow up and grow up FAST. Today, i initially thought i saw a foreseeable path, but it was now shattered. FUCK.. It's all sales at what the fuck level it is. I have come to a conclusion, that i fucking hate consulting. I dunno man....  shit...  I really need to release some stress soon, dudes... Gonna join the gym tomorrow. We'll see how it goes.. Gonna work hard and smart tomorrow. I SWEAR!</td>
